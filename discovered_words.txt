startup
by
ics
alumnus
helps
level
the
playing
field
for
job
seekers
zuhayeer
musa
and
zaheer
mohuiddin
14
want
to
know
what
software
engineers
make
at
companies
like
google
and
facebook
or
how
a
move
from
apple
to
microsoft
might
affect
your
pay
a
startup
company
is
using
crowdsourced
data
to
bring
transparency
to
the
workplace
starting
with
the
tech
industry
to
let
job
seekers
better
evaluate
salaries
our
mission
is
to
help
people
make
better
career
decisions
says
zaheer
mohiuddin
b
s
14
who
graduated
from
uci
s
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
and
cofounded
the
startup
with
uc
berkeley
graduate
zuhayeer
musa
both
majored
in
computer
science
and
quickly
learned
when
entering
the
workforce
that
each
tech
company
has
its
own
system
for
rating
its
engineers
making
it
difficult
to
understand
the
various
levels
or
compare
salaries
across
companies
so
the
two
friends
created
levels
fyi
the
levels
fyi
website
lets
users
visualize
how
an
l3
software
engineer
at
google
compares
to
an
sde
59
software
development
engineer
at
microsoft
and
outlines
what
each
receives
in
compensation
we
currently
have
the
most
accurate
compensation
data
for
technology
careers
says
mohuiddin
who
talks
here
about
what
they
ve
learned
from
collecting
this
data
and
about
plans
to
expand
to
other
industries
the
levels
fyi
website
compares
job
titles
and
compensation
at
various
tech
companies
when
you
first
started
collecting
this
data
what
surprised
you
the
most
it
s
been
astonishing
to
see
just
how
high
tech
salaries
are
it
s
also
interesting
to
see
how
companies
vary
in
their
compensation
plans
as
an
example
netflix
pays
over
400
000
routinely
completely
in
salary
most
companies
cap
their
salaries
at
200
000
and
give
stocks
for
the
rest
of
the
compensation
package
we
ve
also
been
surprised
at
how
willing
people
are
to
share
their
compensation
data
by
making
the
site
100
anonymous
we
hope
to
earn
their
trust
and
make
it
easier
for
people
to
contribute
what
sort
of
feedback
have
you
received
from
people
using
levels
fyi
users
love
the
site
due
to
its
accuracy
and
ease
of
use
with
our
leveling
breakdown
they
re
hungry
for
new
features
and
ways
to
analyze
the
data
we
ve
collected
as
such
we
re
currently
working
on
some
tools
to
slice
and
visualize
the
data
so
users
can
analyze
the
most
relevant
data
for
them
what
has
been
the
biggest
challenge
you
ve
faced
in
developing
this
startup
marketing
has
been
our
biggest
challenge
we
have
very
valuable
data
that
we
display
to
users
for
free
and
yet
still
it
takes
time
and
a
lot
of
marketing
to
spread
the
word
about
the
site
we
ve
naturally
seen
the
site
grow
over
the
last
two
years
and
now
our
biggest
challenge
is
to
retain
our
data
accuracy
we
have
several
initiatives
to
keep
data
accurate
for
a
start
we
ve
begun
collecting
offer
letters
from
job
seekers
which
allows
us
to
validate
the
rest
of
our
dataset
how
has
your
ics
education
helped
along
the
way
building
a
website
that
can
scale
to
thousands
of
users
a
day
requires
some
foundational
ics
knowledge
understanding
the
concepts
behind
the
internet
storing
data
developing
web
pages
etc
has
helped
us
build
a
robust
low
maintenance
and
low
cost
website
keeping
costs
low
has
granted
us
flexibility
to
grow
the
business
without
worrying
about
how
to
fund
its
upkeep
you
now
have
data
for
seven
positions
including
software
engineer
as
well
as
for
internships
and
you
re
working
on
five
more
positions
including
investment
banker
and
civil
engineer
correct
that
s
right
we
re
excited
about
the
new
positions
because
compensation
is
even
more
obscure
outside
of
the
tech
industry
the
internships
page
came
about
as
we
noticed
many
college
students
coming
to
the
site
for
inspiration
around
the
same
time
we
realized
that
many
students
don
t
have
the
privilege
of
interning
because
they
can
t
afford
to
take
on
unpaid
internships
in
the
summer
thus
the
internships
page
was
born
to
help
students
find
well
paying
internships
how
might
greater
transparency
stemming
from
crowdsourced
data
lead
to
positive
changes
in
industry
around
a
year
or
so
ago
when
the
gender
wage
gap
began
to
surface
several
users
requested
we
begin
collecting
gender
information
we
often
hear
from
users
who
have
negotiated
significant
compensation
increases
as
they
re
now
armed
with
data
of
what
s
achievable
we
re
breaking
the
information
asymmetry
between
the
tech
insider
crowd
and
those
who
are
looking
to
break
into
the
market
including
new
grads
minorities
etc
we
hope
that
through
our
data
we
can
level
the
playing
field
for
all
backgrounds
to
be
fairly
compensated
any
words
of
advice
for
ics
students
hoping
to
create
their
own
startups
start
building
when
i
was
at
uci
i
developed
an
iphone
app
that
taught
me
several
essential
skills
in
marketing
and
technology
that
i
use
today
my
first
few
projects
were
not
popular
but
i
took
something
from
every
experience
success
is
always
a
concoction
of
events
ideas
people
and
things
the
more
experiences
you
create
for
yourself
the
more
experience
you
have
to
draw
learnings
from
anything
else
you
d
like
to
add
about
your
experience
i
m
grateful
for
the
many
friends
and
users
who
have
shaped
levels
fyi
into
what
it
is
today
i
ve
been
surprised
on
countless
occasions
by

willing

the
ivecg
hosted
a
three

where
participants
learned
how
to
develop
their
own

workshop
attendees
learning
to
build
their
own
vr
applications
everyone
at
the
workshop
walked
away
with
a
game
they
built
in
unity
and
vr
environment
s
explains
figueira
our
workshop
caters
to
people
from
a
variety
of
backgrounds
and
interests
since
we
teach
the
fundamentals
thoroughly
so
that
attendees
can
leave
knowing
how
to
create
projects
and
where
to
search
for
more
information
such
projects
could
be
for
entertainment
or
research
purposes
for
example
fellow
ivecg
member

ph
d

ali
rostami
is
exploring
whether
immersing
a
burn
victim
patient
in
a
very
cold
vr
environment
such
as
in
the
snow
could
affect
pain
levels
vr
has
already
proven
useful
in
a
variety
of
applications
including
medicine
teaching
and
training
therapy
and
gaming
explains
figueiria
as
vr
continues
to
improve
in
quality
we
will
see
more
useful
applications
come
out
that
could
change
the
way
we
approach
problems
so
head
to
the
library
today
to
check
out
a
headset
and
start
exploring
the
emerging
world

computer
vision
in
smart

was
an
optional
graduate
course
from
electrical
engineering
department
by
dr
hamid
aghajan
the
project
was
a
joint
work
alongside
my
friend
amir
alam
our
project
was
to
detect
the
human
foreground
image
in
each
frame
from
camera
input
and
place
it
properly
in
a
3d
environment
and
let
the
user
in
the
video
interact
with
the
3d
environment
in
real
time
we
provided
a
lamp
in
the
virtual
scene
which
the
user
could
interact
with
and
change
the
lighting
of
the
entire
scene
including
the
user
himself
also
the
3d
shadow
of
user
s
image
was
shown
properly
in
this
project
we
used
unity3d
game
engine
and
the
opencv
library
course
project
of
computer
graphics
in
this
course
first
we
had
to
make
a
3d
scene
in
a
room
consisting
a
window
and
optionally
a
chair
and
a
clock
using
pure
legacy
opengl
picture
blow
shows
the
above
mentioned
room
this
room
has
no
external
resources
and
everything
including
the
models
and
textures
are
computer
generated
using
only
simple
features
of
opengl
consisting
only
triangle
and
line
draw
calls
complete
source
of
the
first
phase
is
available
in
my
github
repository
in
the
next
phases
of
the
project
we
worked
with
modern
opengl
and
included
glsi
programming
and
tried
to
provide
user
interaction
in
the
scene
final
phase
included
realistic
and
properly
placing
textures
and
implementing
phong
illumination
model
and
other
cg
techniques
to
provide
a
better
scene
this

talk
here
about
how
the

has
influenced
and
will
continue
to
influence
their
fields
discussing
a
wide
range
of
topics
from
artificial
intelligence
to
zombie
iot
devices
how
has
the
internet
changed
or
defined
your
field
lopes
how
didn
t
the
internet
change
our
field
when
i
started
college
in
the
1980s
the
internet
was
still
very
small
and
limited
to
email
file
transfers
and
bulletin
board
systems
bbss
there
was
no
web
and
no
search
engines
i
remember
applying
to
graduate
schools
in
the
u
s
by
filling
out
paper
forms
and
sending
them
by
snail
mail
i
also
remember
discovering
some
professors
email
addresses
printed
on
some
papers
and
the
excitement
of
emailing
them
and
receiving
replies
and
how
could
i
forget
the
early
days
of
messaging
with
the
talk
program
in
unix
and
fax
machines
looking
back
everything
felt
so
different
mainly
it
was
much
harder
to
find
information
you
had
to
read
through
paper
manuals
to
find
out
how
to
program
this
or
that
you
had
to
request
papers
from
libraries
or
directly
from
the
authors
the
only
news
of
the
world
came
printed
on
newspapers
and
on
tv
the
hyperconnectivity
we
live
in
today
feels
like
we
moved
to
another
planet
qu
the
internet
has
changed
the
field
of
statistics
in
a
very
fundamental
way
the
most
significant
changes
are
caused
by
the
size
of
data
and
the
dimensionality
of
variables
we
used
to
work
on
low
dimensional
data
and
now
enter
the
big
data
era
with
very
high
dimensional
data
as
collection
for
very
large
scale
data
is
much
more
feasible
due
to
the
internet
this
imposes
a
strong
demand
to
revolutionize
the
statistics
field
in
developing
cutting
edge
methods
theory
and
computing
tools
to
handle
high
dimensional
data
for
example
traditional
variable
selection
is
sufficient
when
the
variable
size
is
small
but
it
can
no
longer
handle
high
dimensional
variables
in
statistical
hypothesis
testing
the
concept
of
false
discovery
rate
was
introduced
due
to
the
large
scale
of
multiple
hypothesis
testing
tsudik
i
m
a
security
and
privacy
researcher
for
me
the
internet
has
been
changing
the
game
tremendously
since
my
graduate
school
days
in
the
late
1980s
just
about
the
time
i
began
grad
school
in
86
the
internet
was
getting
popular
on
the
academic
side
in
fact
my
dissertation
was
internet
focused
it
was
my
ticket
into
security
and
privacy
research
back
then
people
used
the
internet
for
the
most
part
to
access
scarce
resources
like
supercomputers
that
cost
millions
of
dollars
or
you
connected
to
the
internet
to
transfer
files
print
documents
or
read
send
email
the
internet
was
compute
centric
since
then
it
has
gradually
become
information
centric
gazillions
of
mongo
bytes
of
data
are
being
produced
and
consumed
every
single
moment
that
s
the
biggest
game
changer
in
my
opinion
as
is
of
course
the
scale
with
billions
of
devices
of
varying
computing
intelligence
and
people
connected
to
the
internet
at
any
given
time
what
gets
really
interesting
is
that
most
of
these
devices
like
a
ring
doorbell
or
a
nest
thermostat
are
not
traditional
computers
these
iot
embedded
or
cyber
physical
devices
are
special
purpose
gadgets
they
re
the
primitive
life
forms
of
the
computing
world
they
re
not
fully
developed
as
are
general
purpose
computers
but
are
now
suddenly
connected
to
the
internet
and
they
can
sense
and
or
actuate
the
environment
this
creates
numerous
security
and
privacy
and
safety
problems
what
changes
do
you
expect
to
see
over
the
next
few
decades
thanks
to
continued
advances
stemming
from
the
internet
lopes
it
s
really
hard
to
predict
the
future
i
don
t
think
we
re
in
a
good
place
right
now
with
all
the
lies
and
disinformation
that
are
being
spread
through
the
internet
and
with
the
malicious
use
of
technology
i
hope
we
somehow
get
vaccinated
against
this
and
find
a
way
of
restoring
the
sense
of
truth
qu
i
would
expect
more
development
on
artificial
intelligence
and
statistical
thinking
will
be
very
useful
especially
for
machine
learning
and
data
science
the
explosive
growth
of
large
volumes
of
data
with
complex
structures
has
led
to
the
data
science
revolution
due
to
many
different
domain
applications
arising
this
revolution
has
led
to
extraordinary
advances
in
arti
cial
intelligence
and
machine
intelligence
most
importantly
data
science
has
created
opportunities
for
new
directions
in
statistical
research
such
as
nlp
reinforcement
and
generative
learning
recommender
systems
and
information
retrievers
tsudik
i
expect
lots
of
progress
in
all
types
of
transportation
fueled
in
part
by
the
potential
blending
of
the
cellular
and
internet
ecosystems
the
two
are
still
largely
separate
today
i
also
anticipate
significant
advances
in
automating
and
instrumenting
home
office
public
spaces
which
will
undoubtedly
bring
much
improvement
as
well
as
exacerbate
privacy
problems
finally
i
think
that
rapidly
dwindling
storage
costs
and
increasing
communication
speeds
will
fuel
changes
in
social
networking
people
will
begin
recording
storing
exposing
more
of
their
everyday
lives
for
example
recording
and
casting

how
can
we
better
harness
the
power
and
potential
of
the
internet
to
improve
our
daily
lives
lopes
i
think
it
s
time
to
bring
regulation
to
the
table
the
internet
has
been
largely
the
wild
west
so
far
it
needs
to
grow
up
qu
the
power
and
potential
of
harnessing
the
internet
to
improve
our
daily
lives
are
tremendous
examples
include
using
mobile
health
data
to
monitor
our
health
daily
or
incorporating
personal
history
data
and
other
users
information
to
make
better
recommendations
for
reading
news
articles
purchasing
dining
and
entertainment
in
addition
using
mobile
apps
and
social
media
we
can
share
resources
for
example
transportation
sharing
we
can
also
better
monitor
and
avoid
traffic
use
driver
less
cars
and
shop
in
stores
without
waiting
in
line
all
these
revolutions
require
advanced
technology
to
process
imaging
text
speech
and
video
data
with
instantaneous
speed
and
high
accuracy
and
require
us
to
train
next
generation
data
scientists
with
multiple
skills
of
data
processing
computing
and
analytics
tsudik
in
the
last
15
years
we
ve
started
to
see
nontraditional
computing
devices
connecting
to
the
internet
in
the
past
these
devices
looked
like
computers
they
were
laptops
or
desktops
again
what
gets
interesting
is
all
these
other
devices
used
to
be
analog
and
mechanical
suddenly
they
ve
acquired
a
digital
personality
the
doorbell
senses
a
finger
and
actuates
by
producing
a
sound
and
taking
a
video
or
consider
medical
devices
for
example
if
you
are
a
diabetes
sufferer
you
can
wear
an
insulin
pump
that
injects
insulin
when
needed
communicates
wirelessly
and
senses
produces
information
it
clearly
offers
real
benefits
while
prompting
many
security
and
privacy
headaches
what
issues
have
we
overlooked
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
influence
of
the
internet
lopes
the
spread
of
lies
was
largely
overlooked
we
heard
about
kids
addiction
to
their
phones
about
the
potential
harmful
effects
of
video
games
about
online
porn
even
about
our
data
being
tracked
for
nefarious
purposes
but
we
completely
overlooked
the
danger
of
well
planned
psychological
operations
aka
propaganda
on
mass
media
platforms
we
assumed
the
cold
war
was
over
we
were
wrong
qu
data
privacy
and
reliability
are
the
major
issues
recent
facebook
data
privacy
breaches
remind
us
that
we
should
never
take
data
privacy
for
granted
the
internet
facilitates
for
identity
theft
and
credit
fraud
people
have
lost
trust
in
social
media
such
as
facebook
for
sharing
personal
information
for
political
purposes
in
addition
data
distortion
through
biased
sampling
and
missing
data
could
lead
to
misinforming
people
while
the
internet
can
make
unverified
or
misleading
information
spread
quickly
tsudik
the
social
networking
of
today
encourages
both
voyeurism
and
exhibitionism
it
exacerbates
the
look
at
me
i
m
bored
please
feed
me
more
information
i
am
one
of
the
billions
of
people
who
catch
myself
when
i
m
sitting
around
for
a
second
instead
of
maybe
looking
at
the
sky
or
at
nature
i
whip
out
my
phone
and
look
at
the
news
most
of
the
time
there
s
nothing
interesting
happening
but
i
am
an
information
addict
the
information
centered
nature
of
the
internet
and
social
networking
in
particular
is
encouraging
this
kind
of
behavior
information
is
like
a
drug
the
other
important
problem
is
that
the
masses
are
simply
not
educated
enough
about
security
if
you
have
a
child
who
goes
to
middle
school
they
take
health
education
it
s
mandatory
why
are
we
not
teaching
them
internet
health
and
hygiene
we
teach
kids
about
stranger
danger
when
they
re
4
years
old
but
what
about
stranger
danger
on
the
internet
we
don
t
have
much
internet
literacy
for
adults
either
they
make
simple
mistakes
and
fall
victim
to
scams
and
phishing
because
they
re
unaware
of
the
basics
of
internet
privacy
and
security
this
is
something
the
federal
or
at
least
state
government
should
address
it
has
been
reported
that
fake
videos
could
be
the
next
big
problem
in
the
2020
elections
what
role
if
any
will
your
field
play
in
terms
of
helping
address
this
issue
or
the
need
for
election
security
lopes
i
think
we
are
severely
under
prepared
for
what
s
coming
both
in
terms
of
legislation
infrastructure
and
technological
defenses
i
expect
the
worst
honestly
qu
data
could
be
manipulated
and
distorted
in
political
campaigns
statisticians
and
data
scientists
should
play
active
roles
to
develop
improved
statistics
tools
for
data
verification
and
validation
to
ensure
data
integrity
and
reproducibility
scalable
computing
technology
is
highly
needed
to
achieve
real
time
data
checking
tsudik
deep
fakes
are
already
a
giant
problem
my
hope
lies
with
the
ai
or
machine
learning
side
of
things
and
image
processing
election
security
is
a
different
story
most
people
tend
to
be
concerned
with
privacy
because
we
want
to
know
that
our
votes
are
private
security
means
the
integrity
of
votes
and
while
it
s
not
a
pervasive
problem
it
s
a
problem
in
some
places
because
we
don
t
have
a
uniform
voting
system
the
other
thing
with
voting
and
elections
is
fault
tolerance
what
if
things
crash
would
the
election
go
haywire
would
it
have
to
be
redone
that
s
something
i
personally
worry
about
more
than
security
and
privacy
somebody
causing
massive
denial
of
service
or
pervasive
crashes
of
voting
machines
what
if
instead
of
hacking
into
a
voting
machine
i
send
it
some
specially
crafted
packets
or
messages
so
that
it
cannot
reboot
or
just
starts
spinning
on
empty
there
s
no
security
problem
there
s
no
privacy
problem
but
you
can
t
vote
or
you
ve
voted
but
then
i
erased
everything
there
are
fips
federal
information
processing
standards
that
govern
these
things
but
i
think
there
have
been
demonstrated
cases
where
machines
that
were
approved
and
stamped
with
the
highest
marks
still
did
not
provide
the
desired
level
of
fault
tolerance
what
will
be
the
biggest
challenge
we
as
a
society
need
to
address
in
the
next
10
years
and
how
will
the
internet
and
your
field
of
study
help
lopes
the
biggest
challenge
how
to
preserve
the
sense
of
truth
in
a
world
where
realities
are
shaped
by
words
and
images
instantly
available
everywhere
via
the
internet
i
don
t
think
technology
alone
will
be
able
to
tackle
this
education
is
paramount
and
so
is
regulation
qu
the
biggest
challenges
we
will
face
in
the
next
10
years
are
the
global
environment
climate
change
and
disparities
in
social
justice
the
internet
can
help
us
to
be
more
aware
of
these
challenges
so
we
can
make
more
efforts
to
solve
or
mitigate
these
critical
problems
in
the
statistics
field
we
need
to
be
more
active
in
using
historical
and
current
data
to
show
that
these
are
serious
problems
and
provide
accurate
trajectory
predictions
on
the
sustainability
of
the
earth
in
the
next
decade
tsudik
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
in
my
field
is
longevity
of
security
for
example
how
do
we
protect
information
today
we
put
it
in
the
cloud
and
we
encrypt
it
this
includes
sensitive
stuff
like
private
photos
or
medical
records
or
dna
what
happens
10
years
from
now
encryption
that
was
secure
today
is
no
longer
secure
so
if
somebody
gets
a
hold
of
that
old
data
it
becomes
trivially
decryptable
sensitivity
of
some
private
data
doesn
t
dissipate
over
time
what
s
the
alternative
the
alternative
is
to
say
well
i
m
going
to
think
into
the
future
and
instead
of
encrypting
it
using
something
that
is
good
enough
for
today
i
m
going
to
do
something
that
i
think
will
be
good
enough
for
30
years
from
today
then
it
s
going
to
take
you
a
year
to
encrypt
it
or
every
time
you
want
to
access
it
you
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
so
you
re
not
going
to
do
it
that
s
one
of
the
bigger
problems
we
need
to
address
what
research
projects
will
you
be
focused
on
in
the
coming
year
lopes
my
group
is
working
on
three
projects
at
the
moment
one
is
rethinking
the
programming
models
we
use
for
replicated
objects
in
distributed
systems
and
how
to
best
serve
the
needs
of
those
applications
another
one
is
to
collect
curate
and
distribute
software
artifacts
for
research
the
third
is
to
build
bridges
between
neural
network
programming
and
traditional
programming
qu
i
will
focus
on
research
in
differential
privacy
to
ensure
that
we
can
share
data
without
leaking
confidential
information
this
will
be
a
very
important
problem
that
we
need
to
address
in
the
future
in
addition
my
students
and
i
are
currently
working
on
optical
imaging
data
to
identify
hidden
spatial
distributed
microvesicles
which
are
biomarkers
for
invasive
breast
cancer
at
an
early
stage
we
are
also
working
on
dynamic
network
data
to
identify
dynamic
changes
of
community
detection
and
perform
hyperlink
predictions
furthermore
we
are
developing
a
novel
active
learning
method
in
clustering
analysis
when
the
size
of
unlabeled
data
is
super
large
tsudik
in
the
very
near
future
the
average
citizen
will
be
able
to
for
very
little
money
obtain
a
fully
digitized
copy
of
their
own
genome
which
is
essentially
3
2
billion
letters
acgt
some
of
our
own
bioinformatics
faculty
notably
pierre
baldi
work
on
this
topic
on
the
computational
genomics
side
once
this
happens
you
could
go
to
a
doctor
and
be
prescribed
a
treatment
based
on
your
genome
but
what
about
security
and
privacy
if
someone
or
something
e
g
malware
surreptitiously
modifies
your
digitized
genome
you
could
get
administered
the
wrong
medicine
this
could
literally
be
a
life
or
death
situation
which
motivates
my
group
s
research
on
genomic
security
another
area
is
cyberphysical
iot
embedded
system
security
where
we
are
focusing
on
designing
formally
verified
provably
secure
techniques
so
that
you
can
actually
trust
that
a
device
is
not
compromised
or
infected
with
malware
we
re
focusing
on
the
low
end
devices
like
smart
doorbells
or
lightbulbs
which
have
no
ability
to
run
any
kind
of
anti
malware
yet
they
are
accessible
and
can
be
compromised
as
was
the
case
in
2017
with
the
mirai
botnet
a
massive
worldwide
ddos
distributed
denial
of
service
attack
that
focused
on
home
consumer
dvr
cameras
this
clever
malware
infected
a
camera
and
would
sit
there
like
a
zombie
then
on
command
from
some
far
away
control
center
it
would
wake
up
and
send
internet
packets
to
some
specified
target
s
it
would
say
oh
today
we
are
going
to
target
ics
at
uci
and
a
gazillion
of
these
cameras
from
all
over
the
world
would
start
sending
traffic
imagine
it
s
like
being
hosed
from
all
directions
at
the
same
time
by
these
infected
zombies
that
don
t
know
what
they
re
doing
this
poses
a
real
danger
our
research
results
would
let
people
disinfect
their
devices
to
get
rid
of
the
malware
that
s
a
step
forward
and

professor
tsudik
shares
cybersecurity
expertise
during
fulbright
specialist
visit
in
myanmar
distinguished
professor
of
computer
science
gene
tsudik
recently
spent
a
month
in
myanmar
as
part
of
the
fulbright
specialist
program
sponsored
by
the
u
s
state
department
through
the
fulbright
foundation
the
program
sends
u
s
faculty
and
professionals
to
serve
as
expert
consultants
on
curriculum
faculty
development
institutional
planning
and
related
subjects
at
academic
institutions
abroad
fulbright
specialists
are
highly
experienced
well
established
faculty
members
and
professionals
my
four
week
fulbright
specialist
visit
to
myanmar
focused
on
helping
the
university
of
information
technology
uit
create
a
new
cybersecurity
curriculum
says
tsudik
since
myanmar
has
been
transitioning
to
democracy
over
the
last
decade
or
so
their
universities
are
rapidly
developing
degree
programs
and
broadening
subject
coverage
cybersecurity
is
clearly
an
important
part
of
that
in
helping
uit
revamp
its
undergraduate
and
master
s
degree
offerings
in
security
and
privacy
to
add
more
depth
and
breadth
tsudik
gave
a
series
of
lectures
on
advanced
topics
in
security
privacy
and
cryptography
covering
some
of
his
own
recent
research
in
these
areas
as
well
he
gave
more
than
a
dozen
daily
lectures
to
faculty
interested
in
teaching
courses
and
or
conducting
research
in
cybersecurity
they
needed
some
external
help
in
creating
a
more
academic
oriented
curriculum
says
tsudik
they
already
had
some
courses
but
they
were
more
practical
and
job
market
oriented
he
advised
uit
on
creating
security
teaching
modules
and
a
set
of
courses
with
a
detailed
topic
coverage
map
suggested
hours
recommended
textbooks
and
so
on
while
at
uit
tsudik
enthusiastically
advertised
graduate
study
in
the
u
s
including
the
uc
system
in
general
and
uci
in
particular
i
highlighted
the
many
advantages
of
getting
a
u
s
graduate
degree
and
numerous
financial
support
opportunities
such
as
the
fulbright
scholar
program
he
notes
tsudik
also
attended
events
separate
from
his
role
as
a
fulbright
specialist
including
a
hip
hop
dance
party
celebrating
2019
myanmar
cybersecurity
month
the
event
aimed
to
raise
awareness
about
how
to
be
safe
online
gene
tsudik
with
a
local
myanmar
hip
hop
artist
at
the
cybersecurity
awareness
dance
party
held
at
the
american
center
in
yangon
part
of
the
u
s
embassy
more
importantly
in
the
last
days
of
his
visit
tsudik
delivered
a
keynote
speech
reconciling
security
and
safety
in
simple
iot
devices
at
the
third
international
conference
on
advanced
information
technologies
icait
which
took
place
in
yangon
capital
of
myanmar
icait
covers
research
and
development
in
the
fields
of
advanced
information
technologies
so
it
was
a
natural
fit
for
him
to
speak
at
the
event

in

given
the
initial
conditions
leveraging
satellite
data
using
a
nasa
data
set
of
global
satellite
images
captured
daily
over
the
past
20
years
the
team
is
applying
machine
learning
techniques
to
better
understand
the
heat
signatures
and
identify
predictors
of
a
fire
s
growth
and
movement
this
involves
combining
the
heat
signatures
with
other
types
of
data
such
as
the
temperature
humidity
and
moisture
levels
and
vegetation
the
project
involves
combining
heat
signatures
with
other
types
of
data
including
topography
land
cover
and
temperature
data
a
lot
of
the
work
involves
putting
together
the
satellite
data
with
weather
data
and
land
cover
data
and
getting
it
all
registered
says
smyth
the
students
had
to
get
everything
lined
up
in
space
and
time
to
then
see
if
the
machine
learning
model
could
predict
how
large
the
fire
would
be
in
three
days
five
days
and
so
on
the
team
is
currently
looking
at
alaska
but
they
also
hope
to
apply
their
models
to
areas
such
as
the
amazon
africa
and
indonesia
where
large
fires
often
burn
uncontained
additionally
they
re
focusing
on
downstream
smoke
so
populated
areas
can
be
warned
of
potentially
poor
air
quality
right
now
the
models
that
they
use
for
smoke
prediction
are
very
simple
says
smyth
we
re
trying
to
replace
that
with
something
more
sophisticated
he
adds
that
these
are
the
kinds
of
projects
that
really
interest
students
they
get
to
work
with
some
of
the
world
s
experts
and
with
some
really
cool
data
sets
and
they
get
to
make
predictions
that
are
actually
very
useful
to
broad
segments
of
society
indeed
graff
notes
how
improving
awareness
of
and
response
to
wildfires
can
lead
to
more
effective
uses
of
state
fire
resources
improve
quality
of
life
for
people
affected
by
fire
emissions
and
help
responders
better
combat
active
fires
advancing
machine
learning
and
data
science
more
broadly
speaking
the
findings
from
this
work
could
help
with
a
variety
of
other
projects
particularly
given
the
realities
of
global
warming
climate
change
has
widespread
effects
on
our
environment
many
of
which
we
still
do
not
fully
appreciate
or
understand
says
graff
employing
the
use
of
experts
from
different
fields
and
specialties
is
essential
to
properly
understand
the
problem
and
as
the
scale
of
the
data
and
the
scope
of
the
problems
grow
the
role
of
algorithms
to
perform
processing
and
develop
insights
will
grow
too
in
other
words
in
building
models
for
wildfire
prediction
this
work
is
also
advancing
machine
learning
more
generally
according
to
smyth
it
has
brought
up
very
interesting
machine
learning
challenges
for
students
to
work
on
in
depth
generating
new
research
directions
that
are
more
abstract
and
that
have
potentially
broader
applications
beyond
these
specific
problems
maps
students
are
thus
making
discoveries
that
could
have
a
broad
impact
in
the
world
of
data
science
our
ability
to
capture
data
has
grown
tremendously
in
the
last
two
decades
and
it
is
common
for
scientific
problems
to
involve
gigabyte
terabyte
and
even
petabyte
sized
data
sets
explains
graff
as
the
size
of
the
data
grow
powerful
machine
learning
techniques
show
great
benefits
and
are
often
required
to
properly
understand
the
observed
phenomena
smyth
makes
the
point
that
there
s
a
lot
of
data
out
there
we
need
more
people
bringing
it
together
and
using
it

is
the
next
frontier
in
the

a
new
class
offering
at
select
high
schools
in
san
jose
philadelphia
and
cleveland
is
exposing
low
income
students
to
data
analytics
preparing
them
to
leverage
future
career
opportunities
stemming
from
advances
in
machine
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
the
new
curriculum
was
made
possible
with
a
grant
from
deloitte
foundation
which
supports
education
through
a
variety
of
initiatives
that
help
develop
the
talent
of
the
future
and
promote
excellence
in
teaching
research
and
curriculum
innovation
and
base

a
nonprofit
focused
on
engaging
students
from
low
resource
communities
with
stem
education
and
was
developed
in
consultation
with
uc
irvine
the
award
was
made
to
uci
to
develop
a
high
school
data
analytics
course
targeting
the
needs
of
low
income
students
and
involved
a
partnership
between
uci
s
office
of

and
inclusion
oai
for
the
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
and
the
samueli
school
of
engineering
the
goal
is
to
introduce
high
school
seniors
to
data
analytics
so
they
know
how
to
use
analyze
and
visualize
data
and
can
learn
about
possibilities
for
pursuing
further
education
and
career
options
says
sharnnia
artis
assistant
dean
of
access
and
inclusion
together
with
project
team
leaders
from
deloitte
foundation
and
base
11
artis
worked
with
assistant
professors
roderic
crooks
of
informatics
and
sameer
singh
of
computer
science
to
develop
the
curriculum
and
train
the
teachers
high

oai
faculty
and
staff
at
the
data
analytics
course
train
the
trainer
session
held
at
uci
for
low
resource
communities
data
science
offers
a
bridge
to
high
skilled
jobs
says
singh
the
proliferation
of
data
science
means
there
are
jobs
available
in
many
areas
in
fact
data
scientist
was
no
1
on
glassdoor
s
list
of
the
top
50
jobs
in
america
for
2019
singh
also
points
out
that
with
readily
available
public
datasets
documentation
and
source
code
and
the
need
for
only
a
basic
computer
many
of
the
barriers
to
training
are
removed
recognizing
the
role
stem
education
can
play
in
creating
opportunities
the
project
team
set
out
to
design
the
new
data
analytics
course
engaging
and
flexible
by
design
this
was
the
first
time
i
was
helping
to
develop
a
course
at
this
level
so
it
was
challenging
admits
singh
the
project
team
had
to
determine
how
much
technical
background
to
include
for
both
the
students
and
teachers
and
find
ways
to
ground
abstract
machine
learning
concepts
in
examples
relevant
to
the
students
we
focused
on
interactive
exercise
based
teaching
which
is
uncommon
for
how
machine
learning
has
been
traditionally
taught
says
singh
identifying
appropriate
exercises
was
challenging
but
fun
they
also
had
to
account
for
a
wide
range
of
teacher
experience
and
expectations
as
well
as
differences
in
class
size
course
placement
and
geographic
location
the
teachers
they
hosted
in
august
for
a
weeklong
training
session
all
came
from
schools
that
are
part
of
the
cristo
rey
network
of
schools
for
students
from
economically
disadvantaged
families
we
wanted
to
emphasize
the
many
ways
that
data
science
is
already
a
part
of
daily
life
says
crooks
we
included
examples
of
people
using
data
for
creative
inquiry
community
organizing
and
self
expression
in
domains
as
varied
as
public
health
civil
rights
fan
culture
and
professional
sport
flexible
by
design
and
grounded
in
experiential
learning
and
culturally
relevant
pedagogy
students
at
the
various
schools
are
all
learning
the
same
concepts
and
tools
but
they
re
doing
so
using
unique
examples
and
projects
we
wanted
to
create
a
curriculum
that
would
let
students
see
examples
of
data
and
data
science
in
action
and
enable
them
to
choose
to
use
data
for
their
class
projects
that
coincides
with
their
interests
says
crooks
the
curriculum
also
emphasizes
real
world
implications
including
the
potential
for
mistakes
and
data
misuse
results
from
data
analytics
directly
impact
us
says
singh
so
it
is
important
for
high
school
students
to
be
equipped
with
not
only
the
necessary
technical
skills
but
also
an
understanding
of
the
pitfalls
and
shortcomings
so
they
become
responsible
data
scientists
off
to
a
promising
start
with
classes
already
underway
the
pilot
of
this
new
program
is
off
to
an
excellent
start
due
mostly
to
the
very
effective
very
dedicated
teachers
says
crooks
a
key
goal
of
this
first
year
was
to
get
teachers
excited
about
the
vision
for
the
course
and
to
find
ways
to
help
them
adapt
this
vision
to
their
own
students
artis
enthusiastically
agrees
i
think
the
format
of
this
course
is
truly
unique
it
s
really
designed
to
be
culturally
relevant
using
the
students
everyday
experiences
and
embedding
them
into
the
classroom
artis
crooks
and
singh
regularly
check
in
with
the
teachers
and
plan
to
evaluate
the
curriculum
midway
through
the
school
year
and
again
at
the
end
of
the
year
making
adjustments
where

distinguished
professor
of
computer
science
gene
tsudik
recently
spent
a
month
in
myanmar
as
part
of
the
fulbright
specialist
program
sponsored
by
the
u
s
state
department
through
the
fulbright
foundation
the
program
sends
u
s
faculty
and
professionals
to
serve
as
expert
consultants
on
curriculum
faculty
development
institutional
planning
and
related
subjects
at
academic
institutions
abroad
fulbright
specialists
are
highly
experienced
well
established
faculty
members
and
professionals
my
four
week
fulbright
specialist
visit
to
myanmar
focused
on
helping
the
university
of
information
technology
uit
create
a
new
cybersecurity
curriculum
says
tsudik
since
myanmar
has
been
transitioning
to
democracy
over
the
last
decade
or
so
their
universities
are
rapidly
developing
degree
programs
and
broadening
subject
coverage
cybersecurity
is
clearly
an
important
part
of
that
in
helping
uit
revamp
its
undergraduate
and
master
s
degree
offerings
in
security
and
privacy
to
add
more
depth
and
breadth
tsudik
gave
a
series
of
lectures
on
advanced
topics
in
security
privacy
and
cryptography
covering
some
of
his
own
recent
research
in
these
areas
as
well
he
gave
more
than
a
dozen
daily
lectures
to
faculty
interested
in
teaching
courses
and
or
conducting
research
in
cybersecurity
they
needed
some
external
help
in
creating
a
more
academic
oriented
curriculum
says
tsudik
they
already
had
some
courses
but
they
were
more
practical
and
job
market
oriented
he
advised
uit
on
creating
security
teaching
modules
and
a
set
of
courses
with
a
detailed
topic
coverage
map
suggested
hours
recommended
textbooks
and
so
on
while
at
uit
tsudik
enthusiastically
advertised
graduate
study
in
the
u
s
including
the
uc
system
in
general
and
uci
in
particular
i
highlighted
the
many
advantages
of
getting
a
u
s
graduate
degree
and
numerous
financial
support
opportunities
such
as
the
fulbright
scholar
program
he
notes
tsudik
also
attended
events
separate
from
his
role
as
a
fulbright
specialist
including
a
hip
hop
dance
party
celebrating
2019
myanmar
cybersecurity
month
the
event
aimed
to
raise
awareness
about
how
to
be
safe
online
gene
tsudik
with
a
local

artist
at
the
cybersecurity
awareness
dance
party
held
at
the
american

in
yangon
part
of
the

more
importantly
in

service
as
a
marine
and
how
he
typically
spends
his

day
can
you
tell
us
a
bit
about
your
service
i
was
a
rifleman
in
the
united
states
marine
corps
for
four
years
from
2011
to
2015
stationed
at
camp
pendleton
california
during
that
time
i
earned
the
promotion
of
corporal
meritoriously
and
became
a
squad
leader
in
charge
of
12
other
marines
all
those
years
i
was
under
the
command
of
1st
battalion
5th
marines
1st
marine
division
as
the
war
was
coming
to
an
end
we
shifted
to
serve
multiple
deployments
as
the
marine
expeditionary
unit
across
the
pacific
in
those
deployments
to
japan
thailand
guam
south
korea
and
australia
we
created
partnerships
with
the
armies
in
those
countries
to
increase
readiness
and
increase
the

to
a

position
during
a
live
fire
training
right
what
brought
you
to
uci
i
came
to
uci
because
of
the
incredible
computer
science
program
the
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
by
being
separate
from
the
engineering
department
it
allows
students
to
focus
more
on
their
major
and
take
more
core
computer
science
classes
before
i
made
a
decision
on
where
to
transfer
from
saddleback
college
i
already
knew
i
wanted
to
come
to
uci
i
lived
close
by
and
after
visiting
the
campus
on
different
occasions
i
fell
in
love
with
it
it
is
really
awesome
to
walk
around
campus
and
feel
like
you
are
not
in
a
university
because
of
aldrich
park
in
the
middle
of
it
all
what
are
your
future
plans
after
i
graduate
i
plan
on
getting
a
job
as
a
software
developer
in
january
2020
i
am
also
interested
in
consulting
but
i
have
applied
for
different
positions
to
have
options
before
i
decide
what
i
really
want
to
do
the
field
of
computer
science
is
so
vast
that
there
are
many
different
paths
i
could
take
for
my
career
a
dream
job
for
me
would
be
to
work
for
the
fbi
or
cia
developing
new
technology
i
am
really
excited
to
get
out
there
and
start
working
in
the
industry
how
do
you
usually
spend
your
veterans
day
on
veterans
day
i
like
to
get
together
with
fellow
veteran
friends
we
usually
spend
the
day
celebrating
and
thanking
the
lives
of
other
veterans
before
us
who
gave
a
lot
to
protect
this
beautiful
country
of
ours
every
other
year
a
big
group
of
us
like
to
hike
the
first
sergeant
hill
at
camp
pendleton
california
we
choose
to
hike
this
hill
as
it
represents
the
hardships
we
encountered
during
our
time
of
service
it
also
represents
how
thankful
we
are
to
be
able
to
serve
our
country
and
to
give
thanks
to
the
many
men
and
women
who
gave
their
lives
to
protect
us
all
anything
else
you
d
like

i
would
love
for

here
at

to
reach
out
to
other
students
to
share
their
experiences

lessons
learned
throughout
their
years

we
faced

learn
about
the

gained

sang
woo
jun
recently
received
funding
for
two
new
projects
furthering
his
research
into
high
performance
and
high
efficiency
systems
he
was
awarded
500
000
over
three
years
from
the
national
science
foundation
nsf
for
his
grant
mintcloud
an
elastic
multitenant
fpga
cloud
the
mintcloud
project
aims
to
design
a
cloud
platform
for
elastic
allocation
of
field
programmable
gate
array
fpga
resources
and
implement
a
development
and
execution
environment
for
distributed
fpga
acceleration
in
such
a
cloud
environment
the
goal
of
mintcloud
is
to
create
a
hardware
and
software
platform
for
allocation
hardware
accelerator
resources
independently
from
the
host
says
jun
and
to
provide
a
flexible
programming
environment
for
such
elastically
allocated
fpgas
the
platform
would
thus
help
researchers
in
industry
and
academia
rapidly
develop
and
deploy
complex
high
performance
low
power
applications
at
a
low
cost
in
the

jun
was
also
gifted
75
000
from
vmware
research
for
his
project
flash
management
for

this
project
involves
designing
and
evaluating

where
computation
units
are

storage

one
system
architecture
paradigm
gaining
traction
recently
is
near
storage
processing
where
a
processing
unit
is
placed
on
a
storage
device
and
performs
computation
on
data
as
it
is
read
out
from
storage
explains
jun
the
main
benefits
of
this
architecture
are
that
it
can
save
storage
bandwidth
reduce
latency
and
take
advantage
of
the
whole
internal
bandwidth
instead
of
the
limited
performance
allowed
by
the
connection
such
as
pcie
the
collaboration
project
with
vmware
says
jun
is
to
design
and
evaluate
such
an
architecture
on
a
number
of
applications
that
are
important
in
a
cloud
datacenter
context
including
log

back
in
1987
when
david
aha
was
still
a
ph
d
student
in
uci
s
department
of
computer
science
he
had
an
idea
my
plan
was
to
provide
a
location
where
datasets
and
descriptions
of
them
could
be
shared
with
researchers
studying
supervised
learning
recalls
aha
now
the
director
of
the
navy
center
for
applied
research
in
ai
ncarai
at
the
naval
research
laboratory
he
started
with
a
small
number
of
datasets
gathered
by
fellow
ph
d
student
jeff
schlimmer
and
then
waited
to
publicize
the
repository
until
it
had
at
least
25
datasets
once
it
caught
on
he
says
it
became
clear
that
the
collection
had
to
live
on
with
the
dedicated
help
of
subsequent
uci
student
librarians
and
they
ve
been
outstanding
indeed
the
collection
has
lived
on
with
various
faculty
and
ph
d
students
passing
the
baton
to
make
sure
the
collection
has
remained
up
and
running
by
the
time
the
current
librarians
ph
d
students
casey
graff
and
dheeru
dua
took
over
the
uci
machine
learning
repository
had
469
datasets
representing
a
variety
of
applications
domains
from
physical
and
social
sciences
to
business
and
engineering
this
publicly
accessible
archive
has
been
a
tremendous
resource
for
empirical
and
methodological
research
in
machine
learning
for
decades
in
fact
it
has
had
more
than
38
000
citations
since
1998
rendering
it
one
of
the
most
highly
cited
references
across
all
of
computer
science
yet
with
the
growing
number
of
machine
learning
ml
research
papers
algorithms
and
datasets
it
is
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
track
the
latest
performance
numbers
for
a
particular
dataset
identify
suitable
datasets
for
a
given
task
or
replicate
the
results
of
an
algorithm
run
on
a
particular
dataset
to
address
this
issue
computer

professors
sameer

and
padhraic

in

ics
along
with
philip
papadopoulos
director
of

rcic
have
planned
a
next

upgrade
the
trio
was
recently
awarded
1
8
million
for
their
nsf
grant
machine
learning
democratization
via
a
linked
annotated
repository
of
datasets
it
is
quite
an
important
grant
combining
research
computational
infrastructure
and
community
outreach
for
machine
learning
says
singh
the
principal
investigator
the
goal
is
to
enhance
the
current
repository
with
rich
metadata
links
to
research
papers
and
automated
extraction
and
presentation
of
metadata
and
performance
data
the
new
version
will
also
provide
systematic
support
for
reproducible
science
by
letting
users
validate
empirical
ml
results
on
testbed
datasets
ics
is
known
for
its
work
in
ai
and
emphasis
on
ml
says
smyth
and
i
don
t
think
i
am
boasting
when
i
say
that
pretty
much
everyone
in
ai
all
over
the
world
knows
about
the
uci
repository
as
outlined
in
the
grant
proposal
the
repository
had
an
estimated
24
million
visitors
in
2018
with
2
million
dataset
downloads
from
723
unique
web
addresses
and
from
119
different
countries
and
territories
ranging
from
botswana
to
fiji
to
greenland
smyth
himself
started
using
the
repository
long
before
he
came
to
uci
i
was
a
researcher
in
machine
learning
at
jpl
at
the
time
it
first
started
and
remember
being
very
happy
to
find
the
repository
and
be
able
to
download
datasets
and
documentation
for
my
research
he
says
as
noted
in
the
grant
abstract
the
existing
repository
directly
impacts
tens
of
thousands
of
ml
researchers
and
students
by
providing
a
standard
and
widely
cited
set
of
testbed
datasets
to
support
both
research
and
education
the
proposed
improvements
will
support
broader
and
more
systematic
and
reproducible
evaluations
of
ml
algorithms
leading
to
robust
advances
better
calibrated
for
success
in
real
world
environments
helping
in
areas
ranging
from
climate
science
to
personalized
medicine
i
wish
uci
well
on
continuing
to
provide
this
important
service
says
aha
and
encourage
its
continued
growth

just
in

computer
science
major
ryan
yang
has
been
at
uci
for
less
than
a
month
but
he
s
already
making
headlines
with
the
boba
watch
app
he
developed
with
two
friends
from
ucla
alexander
chen
and
callista
wu
as
yang
a
transfer
student
from
pasadena
city
college
has
noted
the
free
app
had
more
than
800
unique
hits
with
500
registered
users
within
the
first
48
minutes
of
going
live
it
turns
out
that
these
three
friends
aren
t
alone
in
their
boba
tea
obsession
and
desire
to
track
related
expenses
how
did
you
first
get
interested
in
computer
science
i
decided
to
major
in
computer
science
back
in
high
school
because
i
love
to
make
things
being
able
to
create
powerful
software
for
positive
change
pushed
me
to
study
on
my
own
so
i
m
mostly
self
taught
but
i
understand
how
critical
it
is
to
learn
the
fundamental
concepts
of
computer
science
at
school
which
is
why
i
chose
to
continue
my
education
after
community
college
here
at
uci
tell
me
about
the
boba
watch
app
which
had
2
300
registered
users
by
the
end
of
the
first
day
we
originally
developed
this
app
at
a
hackathon
at
ucla
i
had
known
callista
from
high
school
and
i
had
met
alex
several
months
back
at
another
hackathon
where
we
were
both
mentors
around
this
time
callista
and
i
started
an
instagram
account
dedicated
to
showing
off
the
various
boba
drinks
we
consumed
and
we
came
up
with
the
idea
to
track
all
of
our
finances
in
an
app
the
morning
of
the
app
release
i
had
to
leave
my
first
two
classes
because
i
couldn
t
contain
my
excitement
but
also
because
i
had
to
focus
on
maintaining
our
servers
and
tracking
our
growth
we
originally
planned
for
maybe
20
or
so
regular
users
due
to
the
niche
audience
we
thought
it
would
cater
to
but
it
turns
out
there
are
thousands
of
us
boba
watch
app
developers
callista
wu
ryan
yang
and
alexander
chen
what
do
you
think
made
the
app
so
popular
the
design
i
cannot
understate
the
importance
of
ui
ux
in
any
project
in
software
development
programmers
often
think
of
their
project
as
a
product
and
their
product
has
something
that
caters
to
consumers
the
truth
is
what
these
developers
are
selling
is
actually
an
experience
that
the
users
have
using
their
product
when
we
made
boba
watch
we
focused
on
executing
the
main
idea
very
well
simplify
the
process
of
recording
your
drink
consumption
rather
than
trying
to
incorporate
as
many
features
as
possible
poorly
similarly
the
app
while
simple
covers
the
main
use
cases
the
individual
aspect
and
the
societal
aspect
individually
the
general
concept
of
the
app
focuses
on
a
person
s
addiction
to
boba
drinks
while
a
public
profile
satisfies
people
s
societal
needs
by
letting
them
express
themselves
and
become
part
of
a
larger
community
the
boba
watch
user
interface
design
you
wanted
to
ensure
there
were
no
security
vulnerabilities
how
did
you
tackle
this
since
we
developed
this
app
during
a
hackathon
we
had
just
36
hours
to
create
an
app
from
scratch
there
were
various
shortcuts
taken
that
would
sacrifice
security
but
allow
us
to
focus
on
the
more
presentable
details
such
as
design
functionality
and
experience
after
the
hackathon
we
decided
that
if
we
were
to
push
this
app
into
production
and
try
to
get
users
to
login
with
their
facebook
accounts
it
was
imperative
that
all
of
the
hacky
code
had
to
be
fixed
i
refactored
several
thousand
lines
of

once
i
do
i
look
forward
to
joining
some
of
the
clubs
and
i
m
definitely
interested
in
going
to
more
hackathons
such
as
the
opioid
hackathon
because
they
let
participants
direct
their
efforts
towards
a
common
cause
to
promote

positive
influence
boba

and
i
hope
that
serves

to
the
opportunities
created
at

what
are
your
plans
for
the
future
i
m
currently
trying
to
see
if
i
can
graduate
in
one
year
and
potentially
start
grad
school
the
next
for
the
most
part
i
don
t
have
a
defined
plan
set
in
stone
because
i
will
jump
at
any
opportunity
that
i
think
will
help
me
achieve
a
higher
level

october

there
are
reminder
apps
for
people
who
frequently
forget
to
take
their
medication
but
what
about
for
those
who
don
t
think
they
need
the
medication
in
the
first
place
culturally
bound
negative
beliefs
about
medications
and
a
preference
to
replace
medications
with
natural
remedies
are
common
in
disadvantaged
latino
communities
states
a
recent
grant
proposal
but
are
rarely
discussed
with
health
providers
due
to
language
barriers
low
health
literacy
and
cultural
distance
the
proposal
comes
from
two
uci
researchers
sergio
gago
masague
and
john
billimek
who
are
working
to
address
this
issue
gago
masague
is
an
assistant
professor
of
teaching
in
the
department
of
computer
science
and
director
of
the
engaging
technology
and
application
design
etad
lab
at
the
california
institute
for
telecommunications
and
information
technology
calit2
billimek
is
the
director
for
community
engagement
and
administrative
affairs
for
the
program
in
medical
education
for
the
latino
community
prime
lc
their
collaboration
has
resulted
in
the
grant
mi
propio
camino
my
own
way
addressing
negative
beliefs
about
medication
to
improve
adherence
among
hispanic
adults
with
hypertension
which
was
recently
awarded
1
8
million
by
the
national
institutes
of
health
nih
through
its
national
heart
lung
and
blood
institute
nhlbi
the
goal
is
to
test
an
intervention
driven
by
an
iot
system
focused
on
addressing
negative
beliefs
about
medication
in
a
large
high
risk
population
latino
adults
with
diabetes
and
uncontrolled
hypertension
says
gago
masague
we
will
test
a
conceptual
framework
that
will
inform
future
development
of
novel
interventions
tailored
for
other
at
risk
populations
gago
masague
is
in
charge
of
the
technical
side
including
software
implementation
data
collection
and
data
visualization
while
billimek
is
leading
the
clinical
side
recruiting
and
interviewing
patients
and
conducting
follow
up
visits
i
ve
worked
with
dr
billimek
for
the
last
four
years
building
a
prototype
for
this
project
says
gago
masague
we
have
mostly
worked
with
students
at
uci
through
the
calit2
multidisciplinary
design
program
for
the
past
few
years
who
helped
with
the
app
design
for
the
study
during
three
group
medical
visit
gmv
sessions
discussions
of
strategies
to
lower
blood
pressure
will
incorporate
not
only
medication
but
also
culturally
bound
perspectives
on
lifestyle
and
natural
remedies
then
patients
will
participate
in
two
brief
instances
of
home
monitoring
with
mhealth
devices
prompting
patients
to
discuss
their
individual
experiences
with
a
regimen
the
hope
is
to
identify
a
way
to
promote
medication
adherence
otherwise
as
noted
in
the
proposal
failing
to
meet
this
need
will
likely
lead
to
continued
disparities
in
adherence
to
evidence
based
antihypertensive
therapies
and
in
preventable
complications
among
the
2
5
million

october

2019
for
the
past
three
years
taneisha
arora
has
been
double
majoring
in
software
engineering
and
data
science
straddling
all
three
departments
in
the
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
with
software
engineering
being
offered
by
the
department
of
informatics
jointly
with
the
department
of
computer
science
and
data
science
offered
through
the
department
of
statistics
the
double
major
supported
her
work
at
the
intersection
of
machine
learning
and
statistics
in
addition
to
her
studies
arora
volunteered
for
the
appjam
program
mentoring
middle
school
students
on
stem
concepts
and
won
a
best
web
app
hackathon
award
then
she
spent
the
past
summer
in
boulder
colorado
interning
at
google
now
as
she
starts
her
senior
year
she
decided
to
swap
her
software
engineering
major
for
a
minor
in
ics
allowing
her
more
time
to
focus
on
her
research
and
take
classes
that
excite
her
tell
me
about
your
decision
to
double
major
and
then
change
it
your
senior
year
i
started
out
as
a
software
engineering
major
but
after
talking
with
my
dad
we
decided
that
because
the
ratio
of
raw
data
to
the
people
who
can
actually
extract
useful
insights
from
it
is
constantly
growing
now
is
a
better
time
than
any
to
learn
the
art
of
data
science
i
was
still
extremely
curious
about
operating
systems
algorithms
and
software
infrastructure
and
i
felt
that
a
more
eclectic
education
would
better
prepare
me
for
the
real
world
so
i
added
the
data
science
major
instead
of
switching
to
it
the
neatest
thing
about
this
combination
of
majors
has
been
the
opportunity
to
simultaneously
develop
a
technical
and
theoretical
understanding
of
statistics
mathematics
and
computer
science
fundamentals
while
also
learning
about
industry
practices
software
design
principles
and
project
management
while
i
could
have
kept
both
majors
and
graduated
on
time
i
decided
this
year
to
take
a
step
back
and
rather
than
finish
up
my
requirements
follow
my
curiosity
and
learn
about
things
that
fascinate
me
ultimately
my
desire
to
keep
that
spark
of
excitement
for
learning
burning
bright
is
what
led
me
to
swap
my
major
for
a
minor
have
you
had
a
favorite
professor
or
class
at
uci
i
ve
had
quite
a
few
actually
my
favorite
professors
include
anton
burtsev
who
taught
cs
143a
and
really
cared
about
us
understanding
the
material
and
professor
andre
van
der
hoek
who
taught
inf
121
software
design
and
is
easily
one
of
the
coolest
professors
especially
when
it
comes
to
encouraging
creativity
i
have
also
enjoyed
my
classes
with
professor
rich
pattis
a
really
quirky
guy
with
so
much
wisdom
my
favorite
computer
science
class
thus
far
has
to
be
cs
122b
the
project
course
on
databases
and
web
apps
taught
by
professor
ray
klefstad
and
teaching
assistant
kelly
mckeown
although
it
was
definitely
the
class
that
i
had
to
work
for
the
most
it
was
undoubtedly
the
one
from
which
i
have
learned
the
most
to
program
four
different
micro
services
and
an
api
gateway
to
bring
them
all
together
in
addition
to
designing
a
fully
functional
and
intuitive
web
front
end
following
a
one
page
design
all
in
10
weeks
was
the
most
unbelievable
academic
experience
although
my
opinion
might
change
after
i
take
bayesian
statistics
this
winter
my
favorite
statistics
course
has
been
stats
120b
we
proved
the
central
limit
theorem
learned
about
the
cool
properties
of
distributions
and
the
power
of
moment
generating
functions
studied
computing
likelihoods
from
density
functions
and
so
much
more
this
was
also
when
the
idea
of
a
random
variable
finally
became
concrete
i
would
have
to
attribute
the
awesomeness
of
this
class
to
professor
weining
shen
who
is
an
absolute
genius
what
has
been
the
best
part
of
your
experience
at
uci
my
entire
experience
here
at
uci
has
been
the
best
i
attribute
this
to
the
incredible
professors
and
mentors
who
have
been
super
encouraging
approachable
and
genuinely
willing
to
help
in
addition
to
all
the
really
cool
smart
quirky
people
in
the
school
of
ics
i
have
met
through
group
projects
club
events
and
classes
opportunities
like
becoming
a
lab
tutor
and
an
appjam
mentor
and
conducting
research
with
professor
van
der
hoek
and
with
statistics
ph
d
student
michelle
nuno
have
simply
reinforced
my
high
opinion
of
uci
and
everyone
in
ics
can
you
talk
more
about
your
tutoring
and
these
research
opportunities
during
my
first
two
years
at
uci
i
was
a
lab
tutor
for
ics
32
33
and
46
it
was
so
exhilarating
to
stare
at
what
in
essence
is
foreign
code
figure
out
why
it
is
broken
or
how
to
solve
the
problem
and
pose
questions
to
ultimately
guide
the
person
i
am
helping
into
discovering
the
solution
this
led
to
me
apply
to
be
an
appjam
mentor
being
able
to
mentor
a
team
of
middle
school
kids
to
turn
their
wildly
creative
ideas
into
a
tangible
app
to
showcase
was
an
absolutely
memorable
experience
in
the
summer
of
my
sophomore
year
i
randomly
emailed
professor
van
der
hoek
and
michelle
nuno
my
instructor
for
stats
7
and
asked
if
they
had
any
research
projects
i
could
work
on
and
what
do
you
know
they
did
i
have
been
working
with
them
on
two
different
projects
ever
since
how
was
it
working
as
a
google
intern
this
summer
it
has
been
an
absolutely
incredible
experience
over
the
course
of
the
summer
i
built
some
debugging
tools
for
google
s
search
notification
scheduling
system
my
project
took
quite
a
few
unexpected
but
very
exciting
and
welcome
turns
talking
to
engineers
and
asking
them
tons
of
questions
about
what
they
were
working
on
was
always
fun
in
addition
to
doing
some
really
fun
technical
stuff
during
my
internship
i
also
got
to
showcase
my
other
hobbies
i
taught
two
cooking
classes
to
other
googlers
and
i
learned
how
to
do
a
handstand
with
my
host
manager
it
was
an
amazing
summer
taneisha
arora
teaching
a
cooking
class
at
google
during
her
summer
internship
do
you
have
any
advice
for
prospective
students
my
biggest
pieces
of
advice
are
first
take
the
classes
that
are
known
to
be
really
hard
because
those
are
the
classes
from
which
you
learn
the
most
and
also
take
a
ton
of
project
classes
second
talk
to
your
professors
and
develop
genuine
connections
with
them
right
from
the
start
finally
actively
look
for
opportunities
outside
of
schoolwork
that
will
let
you
either
apply
what
you
have
learned
in
class
or
force
you
to
pick
things
up
on
your
own
what
are
your
plans
for
the
future
my
immediate
plan
after
graduation
is
to
get
a
job
and
gain
some
real
world
experience
eventually
however
i
am
determined
to
come
back
to
school
to
get
a
ph
d
in
an
area
that
lies
at
the
intersection
of
statistics
and
machine
learning
the
fact
that
i
don
t
yet
know
that
area
of
study
is
why
i
want
to
postpone
going
back
to
school
until
i
have
scraped
as
much
knowledge
as
i
can
working
in
industry
with
experts
in
the
fields
that
i
am
most
curious
about
after
getting
a
ph
d
i
want
to
return
to
industry
as
a
dangerous
force
to
be
reckoned
with
in
my
chosen
field
of
study
after
that
i
hope
to
open
up
a
little
bakery
in
the
foothills
of
the
rockies
and
travel
to
countries
to
teach
students
who
have
few
educational
opportunities
but
first
i
plan
to
attend
ai
uci
club
meetings
more
regularly
this
year
and
to
participate
in
a
ton
more
hackathons

radiation
therapy
is
one
of
the
most
widely
used
cancer
treatments
but
a
drawback
of
the
procedure
is
that
it
can
cause
collateral
damage
to
healthy
tissue
in
proximity
to
cancerous
growths
identifying
organs
at
risk
via
ct
scans
is
a
difficult
and
labor
intensive
process
but
uci
computer
scientists
and
researchers
from
other
institutions
have
developed
an
automated
technique
to
perform
this
function
using
a
deep
learning
algorithm
their
work
was
published
recently
in
nature
machine
intelligence
using
our
model
it
s
possible
to
delineate
an
entire
scan
in
a
few
seconds
a
task
that
would
take
a
human
expert
over
half
an
hour
said
co
author
xiaohui
xie
uci
professor
of
computer
science
on
a
data
set
of
100
ct
scans
our
deep
learning
method
achieved
an
average
similarity
coefficient
of
more
than
78
percent
a
significant
improvement
over
analyses
done
by
radiation
oncologists
the
researchers
focused
on
the
head
and
neck
for
their
study
because
of
the
complex
anatomical
structures
and
dense
distribution
of
organs
in
this
part
of
the
body
also
unintended
irradiation
to
sensitive
tissue
in
this
area
can
lead
to
adverse
side
effects
such
as
difficulty
in
opening
the
mouth
deterioration
of
vision
and
hearing
and
cognitive
impairment
xie
said
the
success
of
his
team
s
approach
can
be
attributed
to
the
model
s
two
stage
design
first
the
system
identifies
regions
containing
vital
organs
and
then
it
extracts
image
features
from
these
focal
areas
our
deep
learning
neural
network
greatly
enhances
the
ability
to
delineate
anatomies
even
with
low
contrast
ct
scans
xie
said
and
the
setup
is
more
computationally

has
developed
such
approaches
to

i
m
very
slow

automated
facial
expression
analysis
has
a
variety
of
applications
in
human
computer
interaction
traditional
methods
mainly
analyze
prototypical
facial
expressions
of
no
more
than
eight
discrete
emotions
as
a
classification
task
however
in
practice
spontaneous
facial
expressions
in
naturalistic
environment
can
represent
not
only
a
wide
range
of
emotions
but
also
different
intensities
within
an
emotion
family
in
such
situation
these
methods
are
not
reliable
or
adequate
in
this
paper
we
propose
to
train
deep
convolutional
neural
networks
cnns
to
analyze
facial
expressions
explainable
in
a
dimensional
emotion
model
the
proposed
method
accommodates
not
only
a
set
of
basic
emotion
expressions
but
also
a
full
range
of
other
emotions
and
subtle
emotion
intensities
that
we
both
feel
in
ourselves
and
perceive
in
others
in
our
daily
life
specifically
we
first
mapped
facial
expressions
into
dimensional
measures
so
that
we
transformed
facial
expression
analysis
from
a
classification
problem
to
a
regression
one
we
then
tested
our
cnn
based
methods
for
facial
expression
regression
and
these
methods
demonstrated
promising
performance
moreover
we
improved
our
method
by
a
bilinear
pooling
which
encodes
second
order
statistics
of
features
we
showed
such
bilinear
cnn
models
significantly
outperformed
their
respective
baselines

to
achieve
parsimonious
inference
in
per
pixel
labeling
tasks
with
a
limited
computational
budget
we
propose
a
pixel
wise
attentional
gating
unit
pag
that
learns
to
selectively
process
a
subset
of
spatial
locations
at
each
layer
of
a
deep
convolutional
network
pag
is
a
generic
architecture
independent
problem
agnostic
mechanism
that
can
be
readily
plugged
in
to
an
existing
model
with
fine
tuning
we
utilize
pag
in
two
ways
1
learning
spatially
varying
pooling
fields
that
improve
model
performance
without
the
extra
computation
cost
associated
with
multi
scale
pooling
and
2
learning
a
dynamic
computation
policy
for
each
pixel
to
decrease
total
computation
while
maintaining
accuracy
we
extensively
evaluate
pag
on
a
variety
of
per
pixel
labeling
tasks
including
semantic
segmentation
boundary
detection
monocular
depth
and
surface
normal
estimation
we
demonstrate
that
pag
allows
competitive
or
state
of
the
art
performance
on
these
tasks
our
experiments
show
that
pag
learns
dynamic
spatial
allocation
of
computation
over
the
input
image
which
provides
better
performance
trade
offs
compared
to
related
approaches
e
g
truncating
deep
models
or
dynamically
skipping
whole
layers
generally
we
observe
pag
can
reduce
computation
by
10
without
noticeable
loss
in
accuracy
and
performance
degrades
gracefully
when
imposing
stronger
computational
constraints

we

this

achieves

that

relating

to

for
solving
a
wide

of

problems
such
as
denoising

given

the

synthesizes
a

the

this

on

we
introduce
multigrid
predictive
filter
flow
mgpff
a
framework
for
unsupervised
learning
on
videos
the
mgpff
takes
as
input
a
pair
of
frames
and
outputs
per
pixel
filters
to
warp
one
frame
to
the
other
compared
to
optical
flow
used
for
warping
frames
mgpff
is
more
powerful
in
modeling
sub
pixel
movement
and
dealing
with
corruption
e
g
motion
blur
we
develop
a
multigrid
coarse
to
fine
modeling
strategy
that
avoids
the
requirement
of
learning
large
filters
to
capture
large
displacement
this
allows
us
to
train
an
extremely
compact
model
4
6mb
which
operates
in
a
progressive
way
over
multiple
resolutions
with
shared
weights
we
train
mgpff
on
unsupervised

form
videos
and
show
that
mgpff
is
able
to
not
only
estimate
long
range
flow
for
frame
reconstruction
and
detect
video
shot
transitions
but
also
readily
amendable
for
video
object
segmentation
and
pose
tracking
where
it
substantially
outperforms
the
published
state
of
the
art
without
bells
and
whistles
moreover
owing
to
mgpff
s
nature
of
per

we
have
the
unique
opportunity
to
visualize
how
each

the
whole
experience
is
a
crash
course
in
mobile

development
and
computer
coding
designed
to
get
kids
excited
about
stem
specifically
computer

says
jilla
in

students
are
able

create
something
they

and
relate
it

how
versatile

and

are
now
preparing

from
the
latest
10

teams
of
up
to

middle

students
will
be
presenting
their
apps
which
they
built
after
learning
the
basics
of
coding
from
college
mentors
with
a
total
of
111
college
students
mentoring
more
than
500
students
from
22
schools
this
2019
spring
cohort
will
be
the
largest
one
yet
making
stem
approachable
and
accessible
it
all
started
back
in
2012
with
just
43
students
at
the
time
jilla
was
a
third
year
computer
science
major
in
the
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
through
his
work
on
the
ics
student
council
he
had
helped
develop
events
like
uci
s
med
appjam
to
expose
fellow
students
to
mobile
app
development
so
when
the
council
was
challenged
with
addressing
gaps
in
stem
education
in
the
k
12
space
jilla
was
prepared
working
with
assistant
professor
of
computer
science
shannon
alfaro
and
with
support
from
the
samueli
foundation
he
and
his
team
developed
the
first
iteration
of
the
appjam
middle
school
outreach
program
during
the
first
year
i
was
not
only
involved
in
developing
it
but
i
also
played
the
role
of
a
mentor
and
taught
at
the
tiger
woods
learning
center
in
anaheim
says
jilla
i
enjoyed
seeing
the
students
be
inspired
and
excited
about
computer
science
for
the
first
few
years
appjam
was
a
project
incubated
under
the
oc
stem
initiative
and
uci
but
as
it
grew
we
began
to
forge
our
own
vision
with
dreams
for
schools
explains
jilla
in
2016
dreams
for
schools
became
a
501c3
nonprofit
organization
focused
on
making
stem
approachable
and
accessible
for
all
with
appjam
as
its
main
outreach
program
mentoring
from
ics
students
the
focus
on
mobile
app
development
captures
student
interest
but
another
critical
element
is
the
college
age
instructors
our
mentorship
model
and
ultimately
the
mentors
are
the
lifeblood
of
the
appjam
program
says
jilla
working
with
local
universities
including
uci
the
program
recruits
students
from
majors
such
as
ics
and
engineering
to
serve
as
appjam
mentors
by
sharing
their
expertise
and
experiences
they
ve
garnered
through
their
time
at
uci
they
are
giving
the
students
they
mentor
a
better
picture
of
possible
paths
they
can
take
in
the
future
uci
computer
science
major
jasmine
delgado
works
with
students
at
kraemer
middle
school
during
the
fall
2018
appjam
program
one
such
mentor
is
second
year
computer
science
major
chase
carnaroli
who
started
coding
in
middle
school
after
seeing
a
learn
to
code
campaign
which
inspired
him
to
take
the
free
khan
academy
computer
science
course
after
completing
the
online
training
he
was
hooked
on
programing
years
later
when
he
learned
about
appjam
during
his
freshman
year
of
college
he
thought
it
was
a
fantastic
opportunity
when
i
was
in
middle
school
there
weren
t
any
programs
like
appjam
i
had
to
learn
everything
on
my
own
through
various
online
tutorials
he
says
now
as
an
appjam
mentor
he
s
helping
to
make
computer
science
more
accessible
to
middle
school
students
the
best
part
about
appjam
is
that
moment
of
excitement
on
the
students
faces
whenever
they
finally
get
a
new
piece
of
code
to
work
he
says
as
a
mentor
it
s
such
a
great
feeling
to
see
your
students
succeed
and
feel
empowered
by
their
new
programming
abilities
he
adds
that
the
experience
has
taught
him
how
to
be
a
more
effective
communicator
being
able
to
break
down
a
topic
into
a
simple
and
easy
to
understand
manner
is
a
skill
that
directly
translates
to
working
with
other
groups
whether
it
be
for
class
projects
or
with
co
workers
he
explains
it
s
amazing
what
you
can
learn
while
teaching
others
jilla
agrees
that
appjam
learning
is
a
two
way
street
both
our
college
mentors
and
our
enrolled
middle
school
students
gain
technical
experience
creating
apps
and
develop
21st
century
life
skills
such
as
creativity
critical
thinking
technical
literacy
communication
and
collaboration
in
fact
carnaroli
credits
the
experience
with
helping
him
earn
a
summer
internship
as
a
software
engineer
at
khan
academy
i
am
thrilled
for
the
opportunity
to
work
at
the
company
that
originally
inspired
me
to
pursue
a
career
in
computer
science
he
says
there
s
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
experience
i
gained
from
working
with
appjam
helped
me
land
an
internship
with
one
of
the
most
impactful
education
nonprofits
in
the
world
another
student
who
has
mentored
for
the
program
is
srivarsha
nandula
an
ics
major
graduating
this
spring
the
best
part
about
mentoring
the
students
is
watching
their
excitement
at
the
showcase
when
all
of
their
hard
work
comes
to
life
she
says
based
on
feedback
from
at
least
one
student
it
seems
nandula
s
instruction
ignited
an
interest
that
will
continue
well
beyond
the
10
week
program
one
of
my
students
told
me
how
she
saw
herself
in
the
future
combining
her
interest
in
fashion
with
her
newfound
knowledge
of
cs
to
launch
an
app
that
would
help
people
in
fashion
says
nandula
who
recently
accepted
a
full
time
job
as
a
program
manager
at
microsoft
she
thanked
me
for
inspiring
her
and
it
made
me
so
proud
to
hear
that
i
was
able
to
make
such
a
strong
and
positive
influence
in
her
life
as
jilla
stresses
these
mentors
serve
as
the
foundation
for
their
teams
ultimately
they
are
the
champions
who
give
these
kids
the
confidence
to
rise
up
to
the
seemingly
daunting
task
of
developing
a
mobile
app
programming
the
future
appjam
is
now
a

where
it

at

virtually
all

require
some
sort
of
stem
knowledge
specifically
technical
knowledge
says
jilla
according
to
a
survey
conducted
last
year
there
is
a
serious
shortage
of
stem
workers
in
the
u
s
creating
a
growing
demand
for
engaging
programs
like
appjam
even
if
students
ultimately
don
t
decide
to
enter
into
a
stem
focused
career
stem
engagement
provides
the
opportunity
for
kids
to
develop
important
soft
skills
like
creativity
intellectual
curiosity
and
problem
solving
it
was
through
his
own
study
of
computer
science
at
uci
that
jilla
says
he
learned
the
importance
of
problem
solving
and
iterative
processes
which
have
played
a
key
role
in
how
we
approach
this

last

at

a
large
scale
hackathon
held
at
usc
the
winner
of
the
best
mobile

went
to
align
created
by
a
team
of
students
from
the
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer

ics
the
app
helps
people
create
interest
driven
support
groups
the
inspiration
for
the
app
came
from
a
brief
talk
given
by
one
of
the
presenters
at
the
opening
ceremony
says
taneisha
arora
a
third
year
student
studying
computer
software
engineering
and
data
science
she
brought
to
our
attention
a
very
prevalent
problem
within
the
multiple
sclerosis
community
although
over
4
million
people
share
the
disease
worldwide
it
is
difficult
to
find
people
with
ms
experiencing
the
same
symptoms
and
therefore
experiences
explains
theja
krishna
a
third
year
computer
science
student
daniel
davies
a
computer
science
master
s
student
from
the
university
of
bristol
in
the
u
k
studying
abroad
this
year
says
the
team
decided
to
build
on
the
idea
of
helping
people
with
ms
connect
with
others
experiencing
similar
symptoms
but
they
expanded
it
why
just
focus
on
people
with
ms
when
there
are
so
many
isolating
conditions
out
there
like
cancers
depression
physical
disabilities
etc
furthermore
davies
says
that
they
also
wanted
to
match
people
by
interests
so
that
people
suffering
with
conditions
have
more
to
talk
about
than
just
their
symptoms
the

arora
krishna

davies
hosted
the
align
app
on
amazon
web
services
aws
and
wrote
it
in

amazon
s

development
environment
they
included
facebook

support
buckets

storage
containers
and
text
matching
align
first
prompts
the
user
for
symptoms
and
filters
the
results
accordingly
displaying
other
people
with
the
same
symptoms
then
we
took
it
a
step
further
says
krishna
we
extracted
everyone
s
facebook
likes
and
categorized
them
into
broader
categories
matching
them
with
the
user
and
ranking
them
accordingly
she
adds
that
the
goal
was
to
give
people
experiencing
illnesses
the
tools
they
need
to
create
their
own
support
groups
based
on
more
than
just
similar
symptoms
all
three
students
were
shocked
to
hear
that
they
had
won
first
place
we
did
not
see
it
coming
says
arora
who
will
be
interning
at
google
this
summer
frankly
i
wasn
t
expecting
a
win
says
krishna
however
we
ended
up
using
several
of
the
tools
offered
by
aws
to
build
our
app
in
a
pretty
innovative
way
both
krishna
and
davies
have
attended
many
hackathons
but
this
was
barely
arora
s
second
hackathon
her
first
was
at
hackuci
in
february
but
because
her
teammate
was
a
mentor
they
couldn
t
present
their
app
at
the
end
watching
the
other
teams
that
were
actually
presenting
grind
relentlessly
to
create
an
mvp
version
of
their
idea
in
under
36
hours
was
absolutely
inspiring
she
says
going
to
hacksc
was
a
mix
of
me
wanting
to
experience
the
crazy
pressure
of
actually
participating
in
a
hackathon
getting
an
opportunity
to
bring
some
of
the
ideas
i
had
been
thinking
about
to
life
and
to
play
with
and
learn
about
new
tech
arora
credits
her
ics
education
for
preparing
her
for
the
experience
the
harder
courses
which
require
you
to
go
from
zero
to
relative
pro
in
a
few
weeks
most
definitely
helped
me
master
the
art
of
getting
work
done
under
extreme
pressure
scenarios
all
while
maintaining
a
calm
composure
all
three
students
seemed
to
have
mastered
the
art
of
innovating
under
pressure
and
were
each
rewarded
with

abstract
market
design
is
an
ancient
human
activity
but
a
relatively
new
part
of
economics
it
seeks
to
understand
how
the
design
of
markets
and
marketplaces
influences
their
performance
to
use
this
growing
understanding
to
fix
markets
when
they
re
broken
and
to
help
to
establish
markets
where
they
are
missing
many
markets
are
matching
markets
in
which
you
can
t
just
choose
what
you
want
even
if
you
can
afford
it
you
also
have
to
be
chosen
in
these
markets
prices
don
t
do
all
the
work
for
example
uci
doesn
t
choose
its
new
students
by
raising
the
tuition
until
just
enough
applications
remain
to
fill
the
entering
class
instead
they
set
the
price
low
enough
so
that
lots
of
people
apply
and
then
they
choose
from
a
big
pool
and
uci
can
t
just
choose
its
students
it
has
to
woo
them
in
competition
with
other
schools
other
examples
of
matching
markets
are
labor
markets
workers
can
t
just
choose
where
to
work
nor
can
employers
just
choose
who
will
work

abstract
market
design
is
an
ancient
human
activity
but
a
relatively
new
part
of
economics
it
seeks
to
understand
how
the
design
of
markets
and
marketplaces
influences
their
performance
to
use
this
growing
understanding
to
fix
markets
when
they
re
broken
and
to
help
to
establish
markets
where
they
are
missing
many
markets
are
matching
markets
in
which
you
can
t
just
choose
what
you
want
even
if
you
can
afford
it
you
also
have
to
be
chosen
in
these
markets
prices
don
t
do
all
the
work
for
example
uci
doesn
t
choose
its
new
students
by
raising
the
tuition
until
just
enough
applications
remain
to
fill
the
entering
class
instead
they
set
the
price
low
enough
so
that
lots
of
people
apply
and
then
they
choose
from
a
big
pool
and
uci
can
t
just
choose
its
students
it
has
to
woo
them
in
competition
with
other
schools
other
examples
of
matching
markets
are
labor
markets
workers
can
t
just
choose
where
to
work
nor
can
employers
just
choose
who

its
impact
promises
to
be

potential
however
researchers
first
must

artificial

is
booming
says
distinguished
professor
of

science
pierre
baldi
who
is
organizing
the
symposium
it
has
many
applications
such
as
self
driving
cars
but
of
course
one
big
area
of
application
is
biology
and
medicine
baldi
who
earlier
this
year
was
named
one
of
the
top
100
ai
leaders
in
drug
discovery
and
advanced
healthcare
explains
that
the
goal
of
the
symposium
is
to
bring
together
a
diverse
group
of
researchers
to
discuss
ai
applications
in
biology
and
medicine
baldi
will
be
talking
about
ai
and
natural
intelligence
in
his
talk
from
ai
to
ni
and
back
he
will
touch
on
how
researchers
have
applied
ai
to
better
understand
the
brain
but
then
he
will
reverse
directions
what
can
we
guess
about
how
the
brain
works
that
could
help
us
make
better
ai
in
the
future
he
asks
ai
can
do
a
lot
of
incredible
things
today
but
it
s
still
very
far
from
being
capable
of
doing
general
intelligent
things
like
a
human
brain
can
do
he
says
what
are
the
ingredients
that
are
missing
to
help
further
his
own
work
he
is
looking
forward
to
hearing
from
other
top
researchers
in
the
field
we
are
delighted
that
s
ren
brunak

atul

two
world

he
says
noting
that
while
some
impressive
applications
have
been
developed
particularly
for
medical
image
analysis
there
are
still
challenges
in
other
areas
such
as
personalized
risk
prediction
over
time
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
what
the
speakers
predict
in
terms
of
realistic
expectations
for
research
and
applications
over
the
next
several
years
smyth

also
talk
at
the

describing
efforts
by

to
automatically
annotate
and
summarize
doctor
patient
conversations
with
the
introduction
of
electronic
health
record
systems
in
the
u
s
in
the
past
decade
doctors
now
spend
a
lot
more
time
typing
information
into
a
computer
rather
than
talking
to
patients
he
explains
we
have
been
working
on
natural
language
processing
and
ml
techniques
that
have
the
potential
to
help
alleviate
this
and
automate
parts
of
a

routine
we
have
made
some
nice
progress
but
there
is
a

it
has
been
more
than
15
years
since
computer
science
professor
nalini
venkatasubramanian
first
realized
the
relevance
of
her
research
to
firefighting
we
started
looking
at
the
area
of
information
flow
for
emergency
response
soon
after
9
11
she
says
referring
to
her
work
with
computer
science
professor
sharad
mehrotra
on
a
large
national
science
foundation
nsf
information
technology
research
project
called
rescue
in
the
process
of
working
through
the
project
it
came
to
our
attention
that
firefighting
was
a
domain
that
could
use
a
lot
of
the
technologies
we
were
developing
professor
nalini
venkatasubramanian
since
then
they
have
worked
on
a
variety
of
related
projects
including
safire
which
focused
on
situational
awareness
for
firefighters
and
was
funded
by
the
department
of
homeland
security
dhs
partnering
with
firefighting
agencies
across
southern
california
they
have
closely
aligned
their
research
efforts
in
the
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
with
the
practical
needs
of
various
fire
departments
venkatasubramanian
and
her
team
also
contributed
to
a
national
fire
protection
association
nfpa
report
developing
a
research
roadmap
for
the
smart
fire
fighter
of
the
future
venkatasubramanian
and
mehrotra
s
current
project
scifire
is
a
collaboration
with
casey
grant
and
kathleen
almand
of
the
nfpa
through
the
national
institute
of
standards
and
technology
nist
they
recently
received
a
second
year
of
funding
for
their
work
to
better
enable
infrastructure
and
information
resilience
for
smart
firefighting
delivering
data
for
situational
awareness
the
scifire
project
continues
the
earlier
work
on
situational
awareness
using
emerging
internet
of
things
iot
technologies
to
make
improvements
during
the
project
s
first
year
the
researchers
explored
how
best
to
gather
and
prioritize
heterogeneous
sensory
data
from
smart
spaces
for
various
stakeholders
during
structural
fires
though
as
grant
notes
in
a
piece
written
for
the
nfpa
journal
the
data
could
be
used
during
other
emergency
situations
as
well
the
team
is
now
working
to
improve
the
reliability
and
resilience
of
the
information
gathered
and
distributed
it
s
a
very
exciting
project
but
we
re
taking
it
step
by
step
because
there
are
a
lot
of
technology
challenges
at
the
device
layer
network
layer
information
layer
and
human
layer
says
venkatasubramanian
we
re
taking
a
structured
approach
that
addresses
both
infrastructure
and
information
reliability
challenges
to
develop
meaningful
technologies
for
firefighters
in
failure
prone
scenarios
understanding
real
world
challenges
enthusiasm
for
new
technology
must
be
balanced
with
the
realities
of
the
job
thanks
to
previous
experiences
participating
in
drills
and
live
burn
training
exercises
venkatasubramanian
knows
all
too
well
the
challenges
that
come
with
real
world
deployment
during
live
burns
camera
visibility
was
reduced
because
of
smoke
she
says
we
even
experienced
failure
when
components
melted
solutions
must
consider
the
extreme
conditions
as
well
as
the
building
materials
and
how
they
interfere
with
data
transmission
and
communication
one
of
the
live
burn
training
exercises
nalini
venkatasubramanian
attended
furthermore
firefighters
can
t
be
distracted
from
their
main
objective
so
any
engagement
with
technology
must
be
seamless
also
because
firefighters
already
carry
a
significant
amount
of
equipment
to
perform
their
job
researchers
can
t
keep
piling
on
more
and
more
devices
as
one
firefighter
indicated
i
m
not
a
christmas
tree
leveraging
smart
buildings
this
is
where
iot
can
come
into
play
and
donald
bren
hall
is
serving
as
a
testbed
for
the
project
for
over
a
year
now
venkatasubramanian
and
mehrotra
have
been
working
with
other
ics
researchers
including
informatics
professor
alfred
kobsa
and
a
team
of
information
systems
group
isg
students
to
transform
dbh
into
a
smart
building
through
the
testbed
for
iot
based
privacy
preserving
pervasive
spaces
tippers
project
the
tippers
team
has
built
a
system
that
manages
more
than
7
000
sensors
in
dbh
and
dynamically
translates
raw
observations
from
those
sensors
into
semantically
meaningful
interpretations
such
as
occupancy
levels
in
different
parts
of
the
building
or
the
location
of
people
buildings
are
smart
these
days
explains
venkatasubramanian
an
infrastructure
might
have
data
that
can
help
during
the
firefighting
process
but
firefighters
need
access
to
that
information
the
plan
is
to
create
a
digital
version
of
a
knox
box
a
typical
knox
box
is
a
small
safe
mounted
on
an
outside
wall
that
holds
keys
to
the
building
which
firefighters
can
access
during
an
emergency
we
re
trying
to
create
an
electronic
knox
box
an
ebox
so
when
there
is
electronic
information
associated
with
the
building
firefighters
can
access
it
during
a
fire
the
ebox
aims
to
provide
information
such
as
floor
plans
wi
fi
passwords
sensor
data
and
surveillance
camera
footage
from
the
building
in
addition
to
creating
an
ebox
to
gather
and
store
this
information
the
team
has
also
developed
firedex
a
fire
data
exchange
system
that
defines
access
levels
and
prioritizes
information
given
network
constraints
it
s
less
important
to
send
camera
feeds
of
a
lecture
or
an
empty
hallway
than
to
send
a
visual
of
regions
impacted
by
the
fire
says
venkatasubramanian
firedex
uses
software
defined
mechanisms
to
decide
how
to
prioritize
data
that
s
useful
for
firefighters
and
deliver
that
data
to
the
appropriate
people
in
real
time
addressing
privacy
concerns
another
challenge
with
smart
spaces
is
knowing
when
and
how
to
release
otherwise
private
information
fortunately
the
tippers
project
is
particularly
well
suited
for
this
work
given
its
emphasis
on
privacy
preserving
spaces
privacy
is
a
very
interesting
issue
says
mehrotra
you
want
to
be
found
when
a
fire
happens
but
you
don
t
want
to
be
tracked
all
the
time
can
we
design
mechanisms
that
determine
when
and
what
to
capture
during
an
event
one
option
is
to
tell
system
users
during
initial
set
up
that
if
smoke
in
the
building
reaches
a
certain
level
or
if
an
alarm
goes
off
it
will
trigger
the
system
to
capture
otherwise
blocked
location
data
to
ensure
you
can
be
found
during
an
emergency
scaling
the
system
the
project
involves
taking
what
is
learned
from
dbh
and
scaling
it
for
high
rise
buildings
we
re
building
the
data
management
technology
to
scale
so
as
the
sensor
data
comes
in
for
six
floors
we
can
scale
it
up
to
100
floors
using
simulation
and
modeling
technologies
says
venkatasubramanian
eventually
this
could
be
expanded
to
gather
data
from
multiple
buildings
to
address
fires
in
larger
smart
spaces
and
in
the
wildland
urban
interface
wui
the
wui
which
is
a
little
more
like
the
paradise
fire
is
different
from
structural
files
she
explains
but
firedex
could
work
here
as
well
the
system
could
collect
information
from
different
sources
at
various
locations
including
sensors
that
capture
air
quality
getting
external
information
about
the
weather
and
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing
and
assimilating
all
that
information
could
help
firefighters
more
strategically
battle
fires
and
better
keep
themselves
safe
so
hopefully
by
the
time
another
15
years
rolls
around
all
of
this
research
will
have
been
transformed
into
a
well
integrated
tool
for
firefighters
that
offers
seamless
access
to
critical
information

background
throughout
the

competition
which
aims
to

yuheng
li
for
li
a
transfer
student
from
china
who
had
previous
experience
trading
in
cryptocurrency
the
competition
s
investment
workshops
provided
a
solid
background
about
the
u
s
federal
reserve
system
i
didn
t
have
any
experience
in
american
stock
trading
so
i
had
to
learn
a
lot
of
things
about
the
american
economy
furthermore
as
a
finalist
he
was
able
to
present
his
investment
portfolio
to
a
panel
of
judges
composed
of
executives
from
growth
management
firms
they
gave
me
some
very
pragmatic
critical
advice
says
li
advice
he
plans
to
apply
when
he
starts
working
at
a
private
equity
firm
after
graduating
this
spring
more
importantly
the
competition
provided
a
practical
way
for
li
to
combine
his
informatics
and
economics
education
i
used
patterns
and
programing
languages
to
scrub
the
data
and
analyze
the
stocks
he
says
sah
says
he
similarly
applied
his
computer
science
skills
to
easily
filter
out
lower
performing
companies
in
the
real
world
says
li
we
will
need
to
combine
knowledge
from
a
lot
of
different
areas
like
chemistry
and
finance
and
programming
to
make
money
or
develop
innovative

he
stresses
how
competitions
like
this
can
help
build
this
critical
multicurricular
knowledge
praneet
sah
in
fact
sah
is
helping
to
build
such
knowledge
with
a
student
club
he
started
shortly
after
last
year
s
competition
at
the
workshops
he
met
rahul
vig
and
jonathan
bravo
and
the
three
likeminded
students
founded
the
hedge
fund
society
the
only
investment
club
on
campus
it
was
going
to
just
be
on
the
investment
side
with
five
to
six
people
pooling
our
own
money
and
investing
in
the
market
and
having
our
own
fund
says
sah
they
created
an
llc
for
investing
but
then
decided
to
branch
out
and
offer
weekly
workshops
for
society
members
the
teaching
actually
took
off
really
well
says
sah
we
have
taught
people
from
so
many
backgrounds
we
had
one
person
show
up
who
is
a
dance
major
in
fall
2018
the
society
s
workshops
covered
fundamental
analysis
and
in
winter
2019
they
covered
technical
analysis
this
quarter
is
focused
on
derivative
trading
finance
is
not
really
what
you
see
in
movies
like
the
wolf
on
wall
street
says
sah
explaining
that
he
wants
people
to
understand
that
a
lot
more
studying
and
reading
are
involved
but
he
compares
it
to
addition
once
you
get
the
fundamentals
there
s
so
much
you
can
do
with
it

sexual
harassment
is
a
difficult
and
complex
topic
admits
irani
but
i
decided
to
take
on
this
role
because
i
feel
so
strongly
that
our

the
mission
of
the
allen
institute
for
artificial
intelligence
ai2
is
to
contribute
to
humanity
through
high
impact
ai
research
and
engineering
in
support
of
that
mission
the
nonprofit
started
by
microsoft
co
founder
paul
allen
often
collaborates
with
other
institutions
and
one
of
its
latest
partnerships
is
with
the
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
researchers
from
a
diversity
of
institutions
bring
different
perspectives
motivations
and
previous
experiences
to
a
cross
institution
collaboration
says
matt
gardner
a
senior
research
scientist
at
ai2
this
is
a
huge
help
in
both
identifying
and
executing
on
the
most
promising
new
research
directions
as
a
member
of
the
allennlp
team
gardner
s
research
focuses
on
deep
learning
for
natural
language
processing
and
he
s
now
furthering
that
work
as
a
visiting
scholar
at
uci
uci
specifically
has
a
strong
history
of
excellence
in
machine
learning
and
employs
several
world
class
scientists
in
the
field
making
this
a
really
beneficial
partnership
for
us
at
ai2
in
particular
gardner
is
working
closely
with
assistant

goal
is
getting

says
singh
whose
group
will
host
additional
ai2
employees
and
interns
throughout
the
year
in
return
ai2
is
providing
funding
for
graduate
student
support
the
team
is
currently
working
to
build
ai
algorithms
that
can
read
and
understand
paragraph
size
text
one
of
paul
allen
s
original
goals
in
starting
ai2
was
to
have
a
computer
that
could
read
a
college
biology
textbook
and
talk
to
you
about
what
is
in
it
explains
gardner
imagine
a
system
that
could
read
all
of
pubmed
and
answer
doctors
questions
about
the
latest
research
related
to
a
particularly
challenging
case
they
see
in
a
patient
or
a
system
that
could
read
all
of
pacer
and
tell
lawyers
what
precedents
are
applicable
to
their
current
litigation
the
ai2
ics
team
is
starting
with
paragraphs
but
will
slowly
build
toward
larger
and
more
complex
pieces
of
text
in
fact
the
collaboration
has
already
produced
a
new
research
dataset
and
a
related
paper
drop
a
reading
comprehension
benchmark
requiring
discrete
reasoning
over
paragraphs
the
paper
introduces
a
new
english
reading
comprehension
benchmark
and
a
model
that
combines
reading
comprehension
methods
with
simple
numerical
reasoning
gardner
and
singh
along
with
singh
s
ph
d
student
dheeru
dua
will
present
the
work
in
june
at
the
2019
annual

of
the
north

of
the
association

naacl
when
i
moved
to
irvine
notes
gardner
sameer
and
i
were
thinking
of
projects
to
start
collaborating
on
and
this
seemed
like
a
natural
fit
something
i
had
been
wanting
to
do
and
that
sameer
and
dheeru
were
excited
about
working
on
singh
and
his
team
are
indeed
excited
about
the
work
ai2
is
a
top
tier
research
institute
says
singh
pleased
with
the
partnership
and
looking
forward
to
continued
work
with
ai2
researchers
we
are
just
now
starting
to
gain
momentum
gardner
agrees
we
ve
done
some
great
work
already
and
we
have
more
in
progress
he
says

when
the
cyber

student
club
was
just
starting
out
computer
science
major
and
founding
club
president
howard
chen
noted
in
an
article
in
two
years
i
want
cyber
to
be
an
official
ics
club
and
i
want
a
competitive
cybersecurity
team
operating
out
of
uci
fast
forward
to
2019
and
cyber
uci
is
not
only
an
official
club
of
the
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
but
its
national
collegiate
cyber
defense
competition
ccdc
team
advanced
to
the
western
regional
championship
for
the
first
time
and
took
third
place
overall
competitive
cybersecurity
team
i
am
still
amazed
by
how
the
new
ccdc
team
came
together
to
reach
even
greater
heights
says
chen
who
graduated
in
2018
and
is
now
an
information
security
specialist
at
meridianlink
he
supported
the
2019
team
by
helping
run
practices
this
year
was
a
challenge
for
the
team
from
every
angle
which
makes
me
especially
proud
of
just
how
well
they
ve
done

golanians
says
he
joined
the
cyber
uci
club
as
soon
as
he
transferred
to
uci
the
club
welcomes
anyone
regardless
of
how
much
they
currently
know
about
the
field
of
cybersecurity
he
says
we
focus
on
learning
together
where
experienced
members
teach
basic
concepts
to
new
members
workshops
competitions
and
opportunities
in
fact
the
ccdc
team
is
just
one
component
of
cyber
uci
the
club
also
offers
security
workshops
sponsors
capture
the
flag
ctf
competitions
and
provides
opportunities
for
members
to
connect
with
professionals
in
the
field
according
to
golanians
workshops
are
a
great
option
for
students
to
jump
right
in
and
gain
a
solid
understanding
about
the
presented
topic
members
and
nonmembers
alike
are
welcome
to
attend
and
the
workshops
usually
have
anywhere
from
10
50
participants
golanians
also
participated
in
the
club
s
2018
ctf
competition
which
presented
a
set
of
security
problems
in
different
categories
such
as
encryption
or
web
applications
and
participants
received
points
for
every
problem
solved
i
really
enjoyed
the
physical
challenges
which
involved
finding
solutions
to
flags
by
exploring
the
campus
and
finding
small
hints
or
details
like
a
true
anteater
it
made
a
regular
day
on

more
exciting
cyber
uci
president
jacob
sigismonti
a
founding
member
of
the
club
says
the
ctf
competition
attracted
100
participants
last
year
we
built
our
own
competition
and
this
year
we
are
competing
in
ucla
s
the
daylong
event
takes
place
saturday
april

my
goal
as
president
is
to
build
a
community
of
people
interested
in
hacking
and
cybersecurity
that
will
help
each
other
in
the
learning
process
says
sigismonti
in
this
day
and
age
there
are
many
more
resources
for
learning
this
kind
of
stuff
but
there
aren
t
really
structured
paths
to
get
started
so
it
s
really
helpful
to
work
with
others
who
are
trying
to
achieve
the
same
goal
according
to
software
engineering
major
and
club
member
rachel
weber
the
club
is
a
great
place
for
networking
and
for
exchanging
news
related
to
the
cybersecurity
industry
and
it
contributes
to
my
education
by
encouraging
me
to
participate
in
educational
cybersecurity
competitions
especially
the
ccdc
in
just
two
years
chen
and
sigismonti

will
receive
the
campuswide
award
for
lecturer
of
the
year
he
is
currently
teaching
ics45c
programming
in
c
as
a
second
language
and
one
of
his
strengths
is
his
emphasis
on
the
practical
application
of
any
topic
he
s
covering
alongside
my
teaching
i
am
also
a
professional
software
engineer
which
drives
me
to
infuse
all
of
my
courses
with
realism
wherever
possible
as
a
senior
software
architect
at
conduent
he
understands
the
importance
of
framing
assignments
in
terms
of
real
world
deployment
one
of
my
primary
goals
across
every
course
i
ve
taught
has
been
to
put
students
work
into
an
intensely
practical
context
in
this
way
he
can
then
show
students
that
they
can
accomplish
building
something
real
sometimes
even
with
relatively
meager
skills
and
in
so
doing
improve
those
skills
singh
is
one
of

faculty
members
who
will

honoree

a
course
in

small

for
use
in
minecraft
since
i
primarily
enjoy
research
i
try
to
design
my
courses
such
that
there
are
many
unrestricted
aspects
he
uses
open
ended
assignments
to
push
students
to
be
more
creative
and
ambitious
and
to
help
them
recognize
how
easy
is
it
to
overestimate
what
they
can
achieve
students
often
struggle
with
the
open
endedness
due
to
unfamiliarity
but
i
feel
they
eventually
learn
valuable
skills
that
make
them
more
confident
and
independent
both
thornton
and
singh
are
looking
forward
to
the
celebration
later
this
month
a
tradition
that

so
it
s
no

to
see
her
on

in
the
donald

you
might
be

however
to
also

old

who

so
when

decided
to
start
a

a
sage
hill
teacher
put
them
in

with
the
uci

their
goal
was
to
introduce
some

to
all

says
irani
even
if
they
didn
t
feel
up
to
taking
the
ap
computer

course
which
can
be
very
challenging
so
irani
reached
out
to
ics
graduate
students
on

recruiting
volunteer
instructors
for
the
club
when
the
stauss
sisters
later
decided
to

irani
again
stepped

says
irani
explaining
her
involvement
with
the
courses
the
grant
money
was
given
officially
to
uci
and
i
helped
administer
the
funds
the
funded
courses
were
held
at
the
boys
and
girls
club
of
santa
ana
and
offered
exclusively
to
middle

girls
sandy
irani
in
an
interview
with
abc7
eyewitness
news
talking
about
the
coding
classes
started
by
hana
and
miya
stauss
irani
met
periodically
with
hana
and
miya
to
help
them
plan
the
courses
and
she
attended
both
the
first
and
last
class
of
each
course
briefly
talking
to
students
about
majoring
in
a
computing
related
field
irani
herself
was
encouraged
to
major
in
electrical
engineering
and
computer
sciences
by
her
father
who
was
a
professor
of
eecs
at
the
university
of
michigan
so
i
had
a
strong
role
model
in
my
own
household
she
admits
the
girls
in
these
classes
are
from
underserved
communities
and
would
normally
never
even
dream
that
a
career
in
a
computing
related
field
is
a
possibility
for
them
she
explains
just
introducing
them
to
basic
coding
concepts
helps
break
down
barriers
and
gets
them
excited
about
coding
irani
helps
middle

this
isn
t
the
only
example
of
high
school
students
introducing
computer
science
to
underserved
communities
milan
narula
and
katherine
mcphie
of
university
high
school
founded
code
open
sesame
to
teach
coding
to
children
at
local
homeless
shelters
although
irani
isn
t
directly
involved
with
the
club
narula
explains
that
she
first
discovered
coding
when
irani
and
ics
student
medhavi
sikaria
16
taught
a
coding
workshop
for
middle
school
girls
professor
irani
was
very
supportive
says
narula
in
fact
irani
s
support
exists
on
a
wide
spectrum
as
the
ics
equity
advisor
she
also
helped
ics
female
graduate
students
network
and
build
a
community
of
it
professionals
yet
irani
prefers
to
downplay
her
role
instead
focusing
on
the
students
in
talking
about
the
courses
at
the
boys
and
girls
club
she
says
it
s
been
thrilling
to
see
hana
and
miya
start
these
classes
and
help
introduce
coding
to
so
many
kids
in
orange
county
praising
the
twins
for
breaking
down
stereotypes
of
the
typical
computer
scientist
she
adds
that
this
in
turn
will
inspire
more
girls
to
choose
a
path
in
information
technology
and
when
they
do
they
ll
find
in
irani
a
supportive
role
model
eager
to
help
pave
the
way
for
their
success
because
as
she
sees
it
it

unfortunately
there
are
a
large
number
of
vulnerabilities
in

such
as
android
and
these
vulnerabilities
can
be
exploited
by
malicious

says
amiri
sani
to
address
this
concern
this
awarded
project
will
use
three
approaches
first
it
will
develop
a
security
monitor
to
provide
security
and
privacy
guarantees
for
a
mobile
device
despite
a
compromised
operating
system
second
it
will
design
novel
tools
to
identify
and
fix
mobile
operating
system
vulnerabilities
finally
it
will
create
a
vetting
layer
to
safeguard
the
operating
system
interface
against
malicious
applications
mobile
devices
are
the
primary
personal
computers
of
many
users

when
computer
science
major
kausthub
raj
jadhav
initially
started
working
with
artificial
intelligence
two
years
ago
he
felt
a
bit
unsure
of
himself
i
accidentally
discovered
ai
when
i
was
trying
to
build
a
more
intelligent
chess
program
my
sophomore
year
at
uci
he
says
i
found
it
very
intimidating
at
first
so
he
decided
to
reach
out
to
other
students
for
help
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
create
an
environment
where
we
could
all
learn
together
explains
jadhav
he
officially
created
that
environment
in
october
2017
with

says
jadhav
we
encourage

and
so
on
to

we
are
on
the
verge
of
a
major
shift
in
transportation
with
self
driving
vehicles
starting
to
appear
on
various
roadways
when
sensor
data
takes
control
of
the
wheel
the
goal
is
fewer
accidents
given
that
94
percent
of
accidents
are
caused
by
human
error
but
what
happens
when
such
sensor
data
comes
under
attack
assistant
professor
of
computer
science
qi
alfred
chen
tackles
this
question
with
his
new
national
science
foundation
nsf
grant
automated
security
analysis
of
software
based
control
in
emerging
smart
transportation
under
sensor
attacks
funded
as
part
of
the
nsf
s
computer
and
information
science
and
engineering
cise
research
initiation
initiative
crii
chen
will
put
the
175
000
toward
evaluating
the
robustness
of
software
based
control
in
emerging
smart
transportation
systems
i
am
very
excited
that
this
proposal
is
funded
so
that
my
group
can
keep
working
on
security
problems
in
emerging
smart
transportation
technologies
such
as
autonomous
driving
says
chen
as
explained
in
the
grant
because
sensor
data
is
collected
from
a
public
channel
the
physical
transportation
environment
it
is
vulnerable
my
group
is
developing
systematic
approaches
to
proactively
identify
and
address
new
security
challenges
in
smart
transportation
systems
before
wide
deployment
hacked
systems
can
alter
control
decisions
in
smart
transportation
functions
leading
to
unsafe
driving
the
group
thus
plans
to
design
a
dynamic
security
analysis
system
based
on
an
evolutionary
algorithm
approach
using
their
research
findings
they
will
propose
novel
solutions
to
challenges
in
generating
analysis
input
discovering
semantic
problems
and
analyzing
dataflow
centric
decision
processes
since
transportation
is
one
of
the
most
basic
urban
functions
our
research
will
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
safety
and
mobility
of
our
everyday
life
says
chen
in
the
long
term
we
expect
our
pioneering
research
efforts
to
fundamentally
change
how
smart
transportation
systems
are
designed
and
implemented
to
offer
stronger
security
and
safety
guarantees

i
was
very

when
i
saw
our
names
on
the
screen
since
there
were
so
many
excellent
works
in
the
poster
session
says
shen
i
think
the
reason
we
got
this
award
is
largely
due
to
the
importance
of
the
work
their
work
analyzes
the
security
property
of
the
localization
module
in
avs
as
shen
explains
localization
is
the
process
the
av
uses
to
estimate
its
current
location
which
serves
as
a
basis
for
other
components
in
the
av
system
such
as
obstacle
perception
and
path
planning
according
to
shen
current
av
systems
usually
adopt
a
multi
sensor
fusion
msf
algorithm
that
can
combine
data
from
multiple
sensors
to
provide
localization
estimates
with
centimeter
level
accuracy
we
leveraged
a
classic
and
practical
sensor
attack
vector
called
gps
spoofing
in
our
security
analysis
of
the
msf
says
shen
their
initial
results
show
that
gps
spoofing
can
cause
estimate
errors
of
up
to
2
meters
in
10
seconds
which
he
says
is
large
enough
for
the
vehicle
to
move
into
the
wrong
traffic
lane
and
make
incorrect
or
even
unsafe
driving
decisions
the
researchers
are
currently
working
on
the
full
paper
for
the

which
will
include
additional
analyses
