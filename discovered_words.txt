startup
by
ics
alumnus
helps
level
the
playing
field
for
job
seekers
zuhayeer
musa
and
zaheer
mohuiddin
14
want
to
know
what
software
engineers
make
at
companies
like
google
and
facebook
or
how
a
move
from
apple
to
microsoft
might
affect
your
pay
a
startup
company
is
using
crowdsourced
data
to
bring
transparency
to
the
workplace
starting
with
the
tech
industry
to
let
job
seekers
better
evaluate
salaries
our
mission
is
to
help
people
make
better
career
decisions
says
zaheer
mohiuddin
b
s
14
who
graduated
from
uci
s
donald
bren
school
of
information
and
computer
sciences
ics
and
cofounded
the
startup
with
uc
berkeley
graduate
zuhayeer
musa
both
majored
in
computer
science
and
quickly
learned
when
entering
the
workforce
that
each
tech
company
has
its
own
system
for
rating
its
engineers
making
it
difficult
to
understand
the
various
levels
or
compare
salaries
across
companies
so
the
two
friends
created
levels
fyi
the
levels
fyi
website
lets
users
visualize
how
an
l3
software
engineer
at
google
compares
to
an
sde
59
software
development
engineer
at
microsoft
and
outlines
what
each
receives
in
compensation
we
currently
have
the
most
accurate
compensation
data
for
technology
careers
says
mohuiddin
who
talks
here
about
what
they
ve
learned
from
collecting
this
data
and
about
plans
to
expand
to
other
industries
the
levels
fyi
website
compares
job
titles
and
compensation
at
various
tech
companies
when
you
first
started
collecting
this
data
what
surprised
you
the
most
it
s
been
astonishing
to
see
just
how
high
tech
salaries
are
it
s
also
interesting
to
see
how
companies
vary
in
their
compensation
plans
as
an
example
netflix
pays
over
400
000
routinely
completely
in
salary
most
companies
cap
their
salaries
at
200
000
and
give
stocks
for
the
rest
of
the
compensation
package
we
ve
also
been
surprised
at
how
willing
people
are
to
share
their
compensation
data
by
making
the
site
100
anonymous
we
hope
to
earn
their
trust
and
make
it
easier
for
people
to
contribute
what
sort
of
feedback
have
you
received
from
people
using
levels
fyi
users
love
the
site
due
to
its
accuracy
and
ease
of
use
with
our
leveling
breakdown
they
re
hungry
for
new
features
and
ways
to
analyze
the
data
we
ve
collected
as
such
we
re
currently
working
on
some
tools
to
slice
and
visualize
the
data
so
users
can
analyze
the
most
relevant
data
for
them
what
has
been
the
biggest
challenge
you
ve
faced
in
developing
this
startup
marketing
has
been
our
biggest
challenge
we
have
very
valuable
data
that
we
display
to
users
for
free
and
yet
still
it
takes
time
and
a
lot
of
marketing
to
spread
the
word
about
the
site
we
ve
naturally
seen
the
site
grow
over
the
last
two
years
and
now
our
biggest
challenge
is
to
retain
our
data
accuracy
we
have
several
initiatives
to
keep
data
accurate
for
a
start
we
ve
begun
collecting
offer
letters
from
job
seekers
which
allows
us
to
validate
the
rest
of
our
dataset
how
has
your
ics
education
helped
along
the
way
building
a
website
that
can
scale
to
thousands
of
users
a
day
requires
some
foundational
ics
knowledge
understanding
the
concepts
behind
the
internet
storing
data
developing
web
pages
etc
has
helped
us
build
a
robust
low
maintenance
and
low
cost
website
keeping
costs
low
has
granted
us
flexibility
to
grow
the
business
without
worrying
about
how
to
fund
its
upkeep
you
now
have
data
for
seven
positions
including
software
engineer
as
well
as
for
internships
and
you
re
working
on
five
more
positions
including
investment
banker
and
civil
engineer
correct
that
s
right
we
re
excited
about
the
new
positions
because
compensation
is
even
more
obscure
outside
of
the
tech
industry
the
internships
page
came
about
as
we
noticed
many
college
students
coming
to
the
site
for
inspiration
around
the
same
time
we
realized
that
many
students
don
t
have
the
privilege
of
interning
because
they
can
t
afford
to
take
on
unpaid
internships
in
the
summer
thus
the
internships
page
was
born
to
help
students
find
well
paying
internships
how
might
greater
transparency
stemming
from
crowdsourced
data
lead
to
positive
changes
in
industry
around
a
year
or
so
ago
when
the
gender
wage
gap
began
to
surface
several
users
requested
we
begin
collecting
gender
information
we
often
hear
from
users
who
have
negotiated
significant
compensation
increases
as
they
re
now
armed
with
data
of
what
s
achievable
we
re
breaking
the
information
asymmetry
between
the
tech
insider
crowd
and
those
who
are
looking
to
break
into
the
market
including
new
grads
minorities
etc
we
hope
that
through
our
data
we
can
level
the
playing
field
for
all
backgrounds
to
be
fairly
compensated
any
words
of
advice
for
ics
students
hoping
to
create
their
own
startups
start
building
when
i
was
at
uci
i
developed
an
iphone
app
that
taught
me
several
essential
skills
in
marketing
and
technology
that
i
use
today
my
first
few
projects
were
not
popular
but
i
took
something
from
every
experience
success
is
always
a
concoction
of
events
ideas
people
and
things
the
more
experiences
you
create
for
yourself
the
more
experience
you
have
to
draw
learnings
from
anything
else
you
d
like
to
add
about
your
experience
i
m
grateful
for
the
many
friends
and
users
who
have
shaped
levels
fyi
into
what
it
is
today
i
ve
been
surprised
on
countless
occasions
by
strangers
willing
to
help
i

love
to
give
back

says
isabela
figueira
a
computer
science
ph
d
student
who
joined
the
ivecg
this
summer
and
helped
develop
a
10
week
course
on
vr
which
will
be
offered
during
the
2020
21
academic
year
as
well
as
a
vr

workshop
thanks
to
the
new

program
students
now
have
easy

units
donated

which
they
can
use

for
example
or
when
building
their
own
programs
for
those
interested
in
learning
how
to
build
their

the
ivecg
hosted
a
three
day
100
vr
worlds
workshop
in
january
where
participants
learned
how
to
develop
their
own
interactive
environments
from
scratch
workshop
attendees
learning
to
build
their
own
vr
applications
everyone
at
the
workshop
walked
away
with
a
game
they
built
in
unity
and
vr
environment
s
explains
figueira
our
workshop
caters
to
people
from
a
variety
of
backgrounds
and
interests
since
we
teach
the
fundamentals
thoroughly
so
that
attendees
can
leave
knowing
how
to
create
projects
and
where
to
search
for
more
information
such
projects
could
be
for
entertainment
or
research
purposes
for
example
fellow
ivecg
member
and
computer
science
ph
d
student
ali
rostami
is
exploring
whether
immersing
a
burn
victim
patient
in
a
very
cold
vr
environment
such
as
in
the
snow
could
affect
pain
levels
vr
has
already
proven
useful
in
a
variety
of
applications
including
medicine
teaching
and
training
therapy
and
gaming
explains
figueiria
as
vr
continues
to
improve
in
quality
we
will
see
more
useful
applications
come
out
that
could
change
the
way
we
approach
problems
so
head
to
the
library
today
to
check
out
a
headset
and
start
exploring
the
emerging
world
of
vr
and
if
you
missed
the
january
workshop
don

course
project
of
computer
vision
in
smart
environments
computer
vision
in
smart
environments
was
an
optional
graduate
course
from
electrical
engineering
department
by
dr
hamid
aghajan
the
project
was
a
joint
work
alongside
my
friend
amir
alam
our
project
was
to
detect
the
human
foreground
image
in
each
frame
from
camera
input
and
place
it
properly
in
a
3d
environment
and
let
the
user
in
the
video
interact
with
the
3d
environment
in
real
time
we
provided
a
lamp
in
the
virtual
scene
which
the
user
could
interact
with
and
change
the
lighting
of
the
entire
scene
including
the
user
himself
also
the
3d
shadow
of
user
s
image
was
shown
properly
in
this
project
we
used
unity3d
game
engine
and
the
opencv
library
course
project
of
computer
graphics
in
this
course
first
we
had
to
make
a
3d
scene
in
a
room
consisting
a
window
and
optionally
a
chair
and
a
clock
using
pure
legacy
opengl
picture
blow
shows
the
above
mentioned
room
this
room
has
no
external
resources
and
everything
including
the
models
and
textures
are
computer
generated
using
only
simple
features
of
opengl
consisting
only
triangle
and
line
draw
calls
complete
source
of
the
first
phase
is
available
in
my
github
repository
in
the
next
phases
of
the
project
we
worked
with
modern
opengl
and
included
glsi
programming
and
tried
to
provide
user
interaction
in
the
scene
final
phase
included
realistic
and
properly
placing
textures
and
implementing
phong
illumination
model
and
other
cg
techniques
to
provide
a
better
scene

talk

and
will
continue
to
influence
their
fields
discussing
a
wide
range
of
topics
from
artificial
intelligence
to
zombie
iot
devices
how
has
the
internet
changed
or
defined
your
field
lopes
how
didn
t
the
internet
change
our
field
when
i
started
college
in
the
1980s
the
internet
was
still
very
small
and
limited
to
email
file
transfers
and
bulletin
board
systems
bbss
there
was
no
web
and
no
search
engines
i
remember
applying
to
graduate
schools
in
the
u
s
by
filling
out
paper
forms
and
sending
them
by
snail
mail
i
also
remember
discovering
some
professors
email
addresses
printed
on
some
papers
and
the
excitement
of
emailing
them
and
receiving
replies
and
how
could
i
forget
the
early
days
of
messaging
with
the
talk
program
in
unix
and
fax
machines
looking
back
everything
felt
so
different
mainly
it
was
much
harder
to
find
information
you
had
to
read
through
paper
manuals
to
find
out
how
to
program
this
or
that
you
had
to
request
papers
from
libraries
or
directly
from
the
authors
the
only
news
of
the
world
came
printed
on
newspapers
and
on
tv
the
hyperconnectivity
we
live
in
today
feels
like
we
moved
to
another
planet
qu
the
internet
has
changed
the
field
of
statistics
in
a
very
fundamental
way
the
most
significant
changes
are
caused
by
the
size
of
data
and
the
dimensionality
of
variables
we
used
to
work
on
low
dimensional
data
and
now
enter
the
big
data
era
with
very
high
dimensional
data
as
collection
for
very
large
scale
data
is
much
more
feasible
due
to
the
internet
this
imposes
a
strong
demand
to
revolutionize
the
statistics
field
in
developing
cutting
edge
methods
theory
and
computing
tools
to
handle
high
dimensional
data
for
example
traditional
variable
selection
is
sufficient
when
the
variable
size
is
small
but
it
can
no
longer
handle
high
dimensional
variables
in
statistical
hypothesis
testing
the
concept
of
false
discovery
rate
was
introduced
due
to
the
large
scale
of
multiple
hypothesis
testing
tsudik
i
m
a
security
and
privacy
researcher
for
me
the
internet
has
been
changing
the
game
tremendously
since
my
graduate
school
days
in
the
late
1980s
just
about
the
time
i
began
grad
school
in
86
the
internet
was
getting
popular
on
the
academic
side
in
fact
my
dissertation
was
internet
focused
it
was
my
ticket
into
security
and
privacy
research
back
then
people
used
the
internet
for
the
most
part
to
access
scarce
resources
like
supercomputers
that
cost
millions
of
dollars
or
you
connected
to
the
internet
to
transfer
files
print
documents
or
read
send
email
the
internet
was
compute
centric
since
then
it
has
gradually
become
information
centric
gazillions
of
mongo
bytes
of
data
are
being
produced
and
consumed
every
single
moment
that
s
the
biggest
game
changer
in
my
opinion
as
is
of
course
the
scale
with
billions
of
devices
of
varying
computing
intelligence
and
people
connected
to
the
internet
at
any
given
time
what
gets
really
interesting
is
that
most
of
these
devices
like
a
ring
doorbell
or
a
nest
thermostat
are
not
traditional
computers
these
iot
embedded
or
cyber
physical
devices
are
special
purpose
gadgets
they
re
the
primitive
life
forms
of
the
computing
world
they
re
not
fully
developed
as
are
general
purpose
computers
but
are
now
suddenly
connected
to
the
internet
and
they
can
sense
and
or
actuate
the
environment
this
creates
numerous
security
and
privacy
and
safety
problems
what
changes
do
you
expect
to
see
over
the
next
few
decades
thanks
to
continued
advances
stemming
from
the
internet
lopes
it
s
really
hard
to
predict
the
future
i
don
t
think
we
re
in
a
good
place
right
now
with
all
the
lies
and
disinformation
that
are
being
spread
through
the
internet
and
with
the
malicious
use
of
technology
i
hope
we
somehow
get
vaccinated
against
this
and
find
a
way
of
restoring
the
sense
of
truth
qu
i
would
expect
more
development
on
artificial
intelligence
and
statistical
thinking
will
be
very
useful
especially
for
machine
learning
and
data
science
the
explosive
growth
of
large
volumes
of
data
with
complex
structures
has
led
to
the
data
science
revolution
due
to
many
different
domain
applications
arising
this
revolution
has
led
to
extraordinary
advances
in
arti
cial
intelligence
and
machine
intelligence
most
importantly
data
science
has
created
opportunities
for
new
directions
in
statistical
research
such
as
nlp
reinforcement
and
generative
learning
recommender
systems
and
information
retrievers
tsudik
i
expect
lots
of
progress
in
all
types
of
transportation
fueled
in
part
by
the
potential
blending
of
the
cellular
and
internet
ecosystems
the
two
are
still
largely
separate
today
i
also
anticipate
significant
advances
in
automating
and
instrumenting
home
office
public
spaces
which
will
undoubtedly
bring
much
improvement
as
well
as
exacerbate
privacy
problems
finally
i
think
that
rapidly
dwindling
storage
costs
and
increasing
communication
speeds
will
fuel
changes
in
social
networking
people
will
begin
recording
storing
exposing
more
of
their
everyday
lives
for
example
recording
and
casting

how
can
we
better
harness
the
power
and
potential
of
the
internet
to
improve
our
daily
lives
lopes
i
think
it
s
time
to
bring
regulation
to
the
table
the
internet
has
been
largely
the
wild
west
so
far
it
needs
to
grow
up
qu
the
power
and
potential
of
harnessing
the
internet
to
improve
our
daily
lives
are
tremendous
examples
include
using
mobile
health
data
to
monitor
our
health
daily
or
incorporating
personal
history
data
and
other
users
information
to
make
better
recommendations
for
reading
news
articles
purchasing
dining
and
entertainment
in
addition
using
mobile
apps
and
social
media
we
can
share
resources
for
example
transportation
sharing
we
can
also
better
monitor
and
avoid
traffic
use
driver
less
cars
and
shop
in
stores
without
waiting
in
line
all
these
revolutions
require
advanced
technology
to
process
imaging
text
speech
and
video
data
with
instantaneous
speed
and
high
accuracy
and
require
us
to
train
next
generation
data
scientists
with
multiple
skills
of
data
processing
computing
and
analytics
tsudik
in
the
last
15
years
we
ve
started
to
see
nontraditional
computing
devices
connecting
to
the
internet
in
the
past
these
devices
looked
like
computers
they
were
laptops
or
desktops
again
what
gets
interesting
is
all
these
other
devices
used
to
be
analog
and
mechanical
suddenly
they
ve
acquired
a
digital
personality
the
doorbell
senses
a
finger
and
actuates
by
producing
a
sound
and
taking
a
video
or
consider
medical
devices
for
example
if
you
are
a
diabetes
sufferer
you
can
wear
an
insulin
pump
that
injects
insulin
when
needed
communicates
wirelessly
and
senses
produces
information
it
clearly
offers
real
benefits
while
prompting
many
security
and
privacy
headaches
what
issues
have
we
overlooked
in
terms
of
dealing
with
the
influence
of
the
internet
lopes
the
spread
of
lies
was
largely
overlooked
we
heard
about
kids
addiction
to
their
phones
about
the
potential
harmful
effects
of
video
games
about
online
porn
even
about
our
data
being
tracked
for
nefarious
purposes
but
we
completely
overlooked
the
danger
of
well
planned
psychological
operations
aka
propaganda
on
mass
media
platforms
we
assumed
the
cold
war
was
over
we
were
wrong
qu
data
privacy
and
reliability
are
the
major
issues
recent
facebook
data
privacy
breaches
remind
us
that
we
should
never
take
data
privacy
for
granted
the
internet
facilitates
for
identity
theft
and
credit
fraud
people
have
lost
trust
in
social
media
such
as
facebook
for
sharing
personal
information
for
political
purposes
in
addition
data
distortion
through
biased
sampling
and
missing
data
could
lead
to
misinforming
people
while
the
internet
can
make
unverified
or
misleading
information
spread
quickly
tsudik
the
social
networking
of
today
encourages
both
voyeurism
and
exhibitionism
it
exacerbates
the
look
at
me
i
m
bored
please
feed
me
more
information
i
am
one
of
the
billions
of
people
who
catch
myself
when
i
m
sitting
around
for
a
second
instead
of
maybe
looking
at
the
sky
or
at
nature
i
whip
out
my
phone
and
look
at
the
news
most
of
the
time
there
s
nothing
interesting
happening
but
i
am
an
information
addict
the
information
centered
nature
of
the
internet
and
social
networking
in
particular
is
encouraging
this
kind
of
behavior
information
is
like
a
drug
the
other
important
problem
is
that
the
masses
are
simply
not
educated
enough
about
security
if
you
have
a
child
who
goes
to
middle
school
they
take
health
education
it
s
mandatory
why
are
we
not
teaching
them
internet
health
and
hygiene
we
teach
kids
about
stranger
danger
when
they
re
4
years
old
but
what
about
stranger
danger
on
the
internet
we
don
t
have
much
internet
literacy
for
adults
either
they
make
simple
mistakes
and
fall
victim
to
scams
and
phishing
because
they
re
unaware
of
the
basics
of
internet
privacy
and
security
this
is
something
the
federal
or
at
least
state
government
should
address
it
has
been
reported
that
fake
videos
could
be
the
next
big
problem
in
the
2020
elections
what
role
if
any
will
your
field
play
in
terms
of
helping
address
this
issue
or
the
need
for
election
security
lopes
i
think
we
are
severely
under
prepared
for
what
s
coming
both
in
terms
of
legislation
infrastructure
and
technological
defenses
i
expect
the
worst
honestly
qu
data
could
be
manipulated
and
distorted
in
political
campaigns
statisticians
and
data
scientists
should
play
active
roles
to
develop
improved
statistics
tools
for
data
verification
and
validation
to
ensure
data
integrity
and
reproducibility
scalable
computing
technology
is
highly
needed
to
achieve
real
time
data
checking
tsudik
deep
fakes
are
already
a
giant
problem
my
hope
lies
with
the
ai
or
machine
learning
side
of
things
and
image
processing
election
security
is
a
different
story
most
people
tend
to
be
concerned
with
privacy
because
we
want
to
know
that
our
votes
are
private
security
means
the
integrity
of
votes
and
while
it
s
not
a
pervasive
problem
it
s
a
problem
in
some
places
because
we
don
t
have
a
uniform
voting
system
the
other
thing
with
voting
and
elections
is
fault
tolerance
what
if
things
crash
would
the
election
go
haywire
would
it
have
to
be
redone
that
s
something
i
personally
worry
about
more
than
security
and
privacy
somebody
causing
massive
denial
of
service
or
pervasive
crashes
of
voting
machines
what
if
instead
of
hacking
into
a
voting
machine
i
send
it
some
specially
crafted
packets
or
messages
so
that
it
cannot
reboot
or
just
starts
spinning
on
empty
there
s
no
security
problem
there
s
no
privacy
problem
but
you
can
t
vote
or
you
ve
voted
but
then
i
erased
everything
there
are
fips
federal
information
processing
standards
that
govern
these
things
but
i
think
there
have
been
demonstrated
cases
where
machines
that
were
approved
and
stamped
with
the
highest
marks
still
did
not
provide
the
desired
level
of
fault
tolerance
what
will
be
the
biggest
challenge
we
as
a
society
need
to
address
in
the
next
10
years
and
how
will
the
internet
and
your
field
of
study
help
lopes
the
biggest
challenge
how
to
preserve
the
sense
of
truth
in
a
world
where
realities
are
shaped
by
words
and
images
instantly
available
everywhere
via
the
internet
i
don
t
think
technology
alone
will
be
able
to
tackle
this
education
is
paramount
and
so
is
regulation
qu
the
biggest
challenges
we
will
face
in
the
next
10
years
are
the
global
environment
climate
change
and
disparities
in
social
justice
the
internet
can
help
us
to
be
more
aware
of
these
challenges
so
we
can
make
more
efforts
to
solve
or
mitigate
these
critical
problems
in
the
statistics
field
we
need
to
be
more
active
in
using
historical
and
current
data
to
show
that
these
are
serious
problems
and
provide
accurate
trajectory
predictions
on
the
sustainability
of
the
earth
in
the
next
decade
tsudik
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
in
my
field
is
longevity
of
security
for
example
how
do
we
protect
information
today
we
put
it
in
the
cloud
and
we
encrypt
it
this
includes
sensitive
stuff
like
private
photos
or
medical
records
or
dna
what
happens
10
years
from
now
encryption
that
was
secure
today
is
no
longer
secure
so
if
somebody
gets
a
hold
of
that
old
data
it
becomes
trivially
decryptable
sensitivity
of
some
private
data
doesn
t
dissipate
over
time
what
s
the
alternative
the
alternative
is
to
say
well
i
m
going
to
think
into
the
future
and
instead
of
encrypting
it
using
something
that
is
good
enough
for
today
i
m
going
to
do
something
that
i
think
will
be
good
enough
for
30
years
from
today
then
it
s
going
to
take
you
a
year
to
encrypt
it
or
every
time
you
want
to
access
it
you
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
so
you
re
not
going
to
do
it
that
s
one
of
the
bigger
problems
we
need
to
address
what
research
projects
will
you
be
focused
on
in
the
coming
year
lopes
my
group
is
working
on
three
projects
at
the
moment
one
is
rethinking
the
programming
models
we
use
for
replicated
objects
in
distributed
systems
and
how
to
best
serve
the
needs
of
those
applications
another
one
is
to
collect
curate
and
distribute
software
artifacts
for
research
the
third
is
to
build
bridges
between
neural
network
programming
and
traditional
programming
qu
i
will
focus
on
research
in
differential
privacy
to
ensure
that
we
can
share
data
without
leaking
confidential
information
this
will
be
a
very
important
problem
that
we
need
to
address
in
the
future
in
addition
my
students
and
i
are
currently
working
on
optical
imaging
data
to
identify
hidden
spatial
distributed
microvesicles
which
are
biomarkers
for
invasive
breast
cancer
at
an
early
stage
we
are
also
working
on
dynamic
network
data
to
identify
dynamic
changes
of
community
detection
and
perform
hyperlink
predictions
furthermore
we
are
developing
a
novel
active
learning
method
in
clustering
analysis
when
the
size
of
unlabeled
data
is
super
large
tsudik
in
the
very
near
future
the
average
citizen
will
be
able
to
for
very
little
money
obtain
a
fully
digitized
copy
of
their
own
genome
which
is
essentially
3
2
billion
letters
acgt
some
of
our
own
bioinformatics
faculty
notably
pierre
baldi
work
on
this
topic
on
the
computational
genomics
side
once
this
happens
you
could
go
to
a
doctor
and
be
prescribed
a
treatment
based
on
your
genome
but
what
about
security
and
privacy
if
someone
or
something
e
g
malware
surreptitiously
modifies
your
digitized
genome
you
could
get
administered
the
wrong
medicine
this
could
literally
be
a
life
or
death
situation
which
motivates
my
group
s
research
on
genomic
security
another
area
is
cyberphysical
iot
embedded
system
security
where
we
are
focusing
on
designing
formally
verified
provably
secure
techniques
so
that
you
can
actually
trust
that
a
device
is
not
compromised
or
infected
with
malware
we
re
focusing
on
the
low
end
devices
like
smart
doorbells
or
lightbulbs
which
have
no
ability
to
run
any
kind
of
anti
malware
yet
they
are
accessible
and
can
be
compromised
as
was
the
case
in
2017
with
the
mirai
botnet
a
massive
worldwide
ddos
distributed
denial
of
service
attack
that
focused
on
home
consumer
dvr
cameras
this
clever
malware
infected
a
camera
and
would
sit
there
like
a
zombie
then
on
command
from
some
far
away
control
center
it
would
wake
up
and
send
internet
packets
to
some
specified
target
s
it
would
say
oh
today
we
are
going
to
target
ics
at
uci
and
a
gazillion
of
these
cameras
from
all
over
the
world
would
start
sending
traffic
imagine
it
s
like
being
hosed
from
all
directions
at
the
same
time
by
these
infected
zombies
that
don
t
know
what
they
re
doing
this
poses
a
real
danger
our
research
results
would
let
people
disinfect
their
devices
to
get
rid
of
the
malware
that
s
a
step
forward
and

professor
tsudik
shares
cybersecurity
expertise
during
fulbright
specialist
visit
in
myanmar
distinguished
professor
of
computer
science
gene
tsudik
recently
spent
a
month
in
myanmar
as
part
of
the
fulbright
specialist
program
sponsored
by
the
u
s
state
department
through
the
fulbright
foundation
the
program
sends
u
s
faculty
and
professionals
to
serve
as
expert
consultants
on
curriculum
faculty
development
institutional
planning
and
related
subjects
at
academic
institutions
abroad
fulbright
specialists
are
highly
experienced
well
established
faculty
members
and
professionals
my
four
week
fulbright
specialist
visit
to
myanmar
focused
on
helping
the
university
of
information
technology
uit
create
a
new
cybersecurity
curriculum
says
tsudik
since
myanmar
has
been
transitioning
to
democracy
over
the
last
decade
or
so
their
universities
are
rapidly
developing
degree
programs
and
broadening
subject
coverage
cybersecurity
is
clearly
an
important
part
of
that
in
helping
uit
revamp
its
undergraduate
and
master
s
degree
offerings
in
security
and
privacy
to
add
more
depth
and
breadth
tsudik
gave
a
series
of
lectures
on
advanced
topics
in
security
privacy
and
cryptography
covering
some
of
his
own
recent
research
in
these
areas
as
well
he
gave
more
than
a
dozen
daily
lectures
to
faculty
interested
in
teaching
courses
and
or
conducting
research
in
cybersecurity
they
needed
some
external
help
in
creating
a
more
academic
oriented
curriculum
says
tsudik
they
already
had
some
courses
but
they
were
more
practical
and
job
market
oriented
he
advised
uit
on
creating
security
teaching
modules
and
a
set
of
courses
with
a
detailed
topic
coverage
map
suggested
hours
recommended
textbooks
and
so
on
while
at
uit
tsudik
enthusiastically
advertised
graduate
study
in
the
u
s
including
the
uc
system
in
general
and
uci
in
particular
i
highlighted
the
many
advantages
of
getting
a
u
s
graduate
degree
and
numerous
financial
support
opportunities
such
as
the
fulbright
scholar
program
he
notes
tsudik
also
attended
events
separate
from
his
role
as
a
fulbright
specialist
including
a
hip
hop
dance
party
celebrating
2019
myanmar
cybersecurity
month
the
event
aimed
to
raise
awareness
about
how
to
be
safe
online
gene
tsudik
with
a
local
myanmar
hip
hop
artist
at
the
cybersecurity
awareness
dance
party
held
at
the
american
center
in
yangon
part
of
the
u
s
embassy
more
importantly
in
the
last
days
of
his
visit
tsudik
delivered
a
keynote
speech
reconciling
security
and
safety
in
simple
iot
devices
at
the
third
international
conference
on
advanced
information
technologies
icait
which
took
place
in
yangon
capital
of
myanmar
icait
covers
research
and
development
in
the
fields
of
advanced
information
technologies
so
it
was
a
natural
fit
for
him
to
speak
at

large

in

as

mostly

smaller

companies
will
usually
start
in
winter
beginning
as
early
as
december
january
once
you
have
identified
your
target
companies
we
recommend
you
visit
their
career
university
pages
to
find
the
internship
postings
most
of
them
have
deadlines
that
you
should
not
miss
if
you
do
not
see
a
posting
set
up
email
notifications
through
their
website
so
you
are
alerted
right
away
and
can
apply
as
soon
as
the
position
is
posted
regardless
of
when
you
apply
the
most
important
thing
is
to
make
sure
you
meet
the
application
deadline
if
any
we
recommend
you
submit
your
application
at
least
one
week
prior
to
the
deadline
listed
if
i
am
interested
in
an
internship
at
a
company
should
i
apply
directly
on
their
website
or
should
i
go
through
a
recruiter
would
it
be
harmful
to
apply
through
both
if
you
see
an
internship
postings
on
a
company
s
website
and
you
are
confident
with
your
application
materials
we
recommend
you
apply
as
soon
as
possible
please
also
pay
careful
attention
on
the
postings
to
see
whether
there
is
a
deadline
to
apply
and
plan
to
apply
at
least
one
week
prior
to
that
deadline
for
larger
companies
anyone
you
talk
to
will
likely
direct
you
to
apply
on
the
company
website
including
the
recruiter
it
will
not
be
harmful
to
do
both
however
another
way
is
to
reach
out
to
your
current
contacts
at
the
company
if
you
have
any
to
see
if
they
are
able
to
make
a
referral
before
you
submit
your
online
application
this
way
some
job
sites
may
allow
you
to
include
the
employee
s
name
as
your
referral
even
better
your
contact
may
send
your
information
to
their
seniors
or
managers
which
will
help
you
in
the
entire
process
and
increase
your
chances
for
being
invited
for
interviews
what
is
the
typical
timeline
for
an
internship
application
i
e
once
i
submit
my
online
application
when
should
i
expect
a
phone
interview
technical
interview
on
site
interview
and
the
offer
industry
research
shows
that
on
average
the
entire
recruitment
process
from
sourcing
a
candidate
to
hiring
a
candidate
takes
26
business
days
while
this
timeline
is
mostly
accurate
this
timeline
does
vary
with
different
companies
regardless
of
their
size
some
students
received
call
backs
within
one
week
of
application
submission
some
received
call
backs
one
or
even
two
months
later
the
key
is
your
follow
up
sometimes
that
makes
a
significant
difference
in
how
fast
the
process
will
move
forward
if
it
moves
forward
at
all
will
networking
and
connecting
with
hr
recruiters
increase
my
chances
of
getting
hired
for
internship
positions
you
will
quickly
learn
that
hr
recruiters
play
the
role
of
a
gatekeeper
ensure
equal
opportunities
and
manage
a
fair
and
consistent
recruiting
process
for
all
applicants
as
such
due
to
the
high
volume
of
applicants
they
receive
an
hr
recruiter
will
most
likely
redirect
you
to
apply
via
the
company
s
website
for
full
time
positions
however
a
company
s
recruiting
process
can
be
a
bit
different
wherein
an
hr
recruiter
may
be
more
responsive
because
they
may
actually
be
seeking
you
out
to
consider
their
company
for
employment
again
this
varies
depending
on
the
company
and
how
they
leverage
their
recruiters
in
all
while
it
is
good
to
know
recruiters
we
encourage
you
focus
your
networking
effort
in
connecting
with
actual
working
professionals
including
uci
alumni
who
are
working
or
have
worked
at
your
target
companies
usually
these
contacts
can
offer
additional
advice
for
you
and
some
may
have
insights
as
to
hiring
needs
within
their
teams
what
happens
if
i
am
unable
to
secure
an
internship
first
and
foremost
let
s
stay
positive
from
the
get
go
and
approach
your
search
with
the
intended
result
of
securing
an
internship
this
mental
shift
will
help
you
tremendously
throughout
your
search

while

a
summer
internship

be
a
priority

from

what
did
you
do
for
wics
events
new
ideas
etc
i
was
part
of
wics
for
the
four
years
i
was
at
uc
irvine
i
first
joined
as
a
committee
member
as
a
freshman
my
junior
year
i
decided
to
run
for
external
vice
president
and
then
president
for
my
senior
year
it
was
great
because
i
was
part
of
the
marketing
committee
my
first
two
years
so
as
external
vp
it
was
helpful
to
plan
events
with
companies
and
then
work
with
the
marketing
committee
to
get
all
the
information
out
to
our
members
why
do
you
think
wics
is
helpful
wics
was
a
big
part
of
my
college
experience
and
it
was
helpful
in
connecting
me
with
other
people
who
had
the
same
interests
i
was
able
to
get
valuable
advice
from
existing
members
of
wics
and
they
became
some
of
my
closest
friends
who
i
still
keep
in
touch
with
even
after
college
wics
holds
many
useful
workshops
and
info
sessions
such
as
networking
workshops
or
resume
workshops
and
sometimes
they
are
partnered
with
companies
so
students
can
get
direct
tips
and
feedback
from
someone
in
the
industry
i
think
all
of
our
events
were
a
huge
success
and
it
s
so
hard
to
just
choose
one
ranging
from
our
weekly
meetings
to
allowing
30
students
to
attend
grace
hopper
to
holding
our
own
cwic
conference
i
think
they
all
were
successful
in
their
own
way
a
study
session
can
seem
so
minuscule
but
to
some
it
was
a
great
way
to
find
peers
in
the
same
class
that
they
have
never
met
before
grace
hopper
i
can
t
even
describe
how
wonderful
that
opportunity
is
and
how
fortunate
wics
is
to
receive
the
grant
to
allow
so
many
students
to
attend
then
there
s
cwic
where
my
co
president
ericca
go
and
i
decided
to
host
the
biannual
conference
at
uc
irvine
we
had
i
believe
about
150
attendees
and
it
was
a
great
turnout
it
was
a
way
for
us
to
bring
a
mini
version
of
grace
hopper
to
local
schools
to
support
and
inspire
everyone
around
what
do
you
do
now
what
are
some
achievements
you
d
like
to
share
currently
i
am
a

working

live
while

i

glad
to
say
that
i
am
still
part
of
helping
the
community
by

you

don

why
do
you
think
wics
is
helpful
i
wanted
to
join
wics
because
i
was
originally
a
pharmaceutical
sciences
major
who
decided
to
switch
to
computer
science
and
i
had
no
idea
how
i
would
navigate
this
whole
new
world
wics
provided
me
with
a
plethora
of
opportunities
to
see
different
career
paths
and
converse
with
students
and
companies
the
organization
essentially
supported
me
in
my
transition
to
software
engineering
and
i
still
keep
in
touch
with
the
friends
that
i
ve
made
from
the
events
some
of
whom
i
am
currently
working
in
the
same
state
with
most
of
all
i
received
my
internship
and
job
opportunities
as
a
result
of
being
in
wics
what
did
you
do
for
wics
events
new
ideas
etc
i
first
started
out
as
a
wics
general
member
and
excitedly
joined
the
committee
where
i
was
placed
into
the
corporate
committee
then
i
ran
for
treasurer
before
i
started
leading
wics
as
co
president
in
2016
2017
i
was
always
excited
to
work
on
outreach
projects
because
i
knew
first
hand
how
overwhelming
computer
science
can
seem
especially
in
the
beginning
therefore
i
focused
heavily
on
outreach
and
co
wrote
a
proposal
that
won
the
10
000
trailblazer
award
from
ncwit
which
were
used
to
create
a
mentorship
program
for
undeclared
majors
here
at
uci
were
there
any
memorable
events
that
you
felt
were
a
huge
success
what
did
you
like
about
them
one
of
my
favorite
events
was
a
social
game
night
where
we
just
brought
in
a
bunch
of
board
games
and
food
and
just
enjoyed
the
time
a
few
others
even
surprised
the
group
with
super
smash
bros
and
that
really
added
to
the
community
spirit
that
were
prevalent
that
night
it
was
definitely
a
great
way
to
get
to
know
people
what
do
you
do
now
what
are
some
achievements
you
d
like
to
share
i
am
a
software
development
engineer
ii
at
expedia
group
where
i
work
on
full
stack
applications
and
know
the
difference
between
backend
and
frontend
i
ve
also
developed
some
skills
in
ping
pong
and
foosball
do
you
have
any
words
of
wisdom
to
share
to
females
in
stem
when
i
switched
majors
to
computer
science
i
was
in
my
third
year
and
always
felt
like
i
was
behind
whenever
i
introduced
myself
as
a
junior
i
had
to
include
that
i
had
just
switched
majors
lots
of
imposter
syndrome
if
you
re
ever
in
that
position
you
have
to
push
through
that
initial
uncomfortable
start
because
it
will
get
so
much
better
i
remember
my
struggles
to
even
understand
basic
cs
concepts
in
the
beginning
and
now
it
feels
so
great
to
pick
things
up
quickly
as
i
become
familiarized
with
different
technologies
it
also
helps
to
have
some
support
whether
that
means
coming
to
a
wics
meeting
for
the
first
time
speaking
to
your
classmate
that
sits
on
the
right
or
coming
to
your
professor
ta
s
office
hours
it
is
immensely
important
to
ask
questions
and
let
people
know
when
you
need
help
or
don
t
understand
something
we
all
started
from
somewhere
for
those
that
are
headed
to
their
first
job
i
will
give
you
similar
advice
be
okay
with
not
knowing
much
but
immerse
yourself
and
you
ll
look
back
a
year
later
and
see
how
much
you
have
grown
as
an
entry
level
engineer
you
are
not
expected
to
know
everything
but
do
try
to
put
some
effort
in
to
look
up
things
that
are
foreign
to
you
when
it
takes
a
lot
more
time
to
understand
something
it
would
be
much
better
to
speak
to
someone
more
senior
and
have
them
clarify
the
concept
tech
good
luck
and
have
fun
in
the
process

katie
khuu
and
i
switched
the
projects
committee
to
the
community
outreach
committee
and
at
the
end
of
our
tenure
made
the
position
require
two
people
to
head
it
we
had
a
board
retreat
over
the
summer
to
plan
events
and
when
we
interviewed
people
for
committee
we
opened
it
up
to
the
rest
of
board
members
to
interview
them
as
well
we
also
applied
for
and
got
a
22k
ncwit
grants
student
seed
fund
i
think
it
was
as
well
as
secured
google
and
facebook
as
corporate
sponsors
for
the
first
time
why
do
you
think
wics
is
helpful
i
was
scared
to
send
emails
when
i
first
started
going
from
that
to
becoming
president
and
having
to
send
emails
all
the
time
was
a
huge
journey
for
me
i
also
learned
a
lot
about
leadership
and
working
with
others
both
from
being
led
and
then
learning
what
i
liked
disliked
from
that
and
then
applying
it
as
marketing
chair
and
then
president
i
also
didn
t
know
i
could
be
a
president
until
i
was
i
was
scared
of
running
because
of
the
public
speaking
aspect
of
being
a
president
but
then
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
i
felt
like
i
really
had
something
to
contribute
and
that
if
i
didn
t
try
i
would
be
doing
myself
and
club
a
disservice
were
there
any
memorable
events
that
you
felt
were
a
huge
success
what
did
you
like
about
them
i
m
totally
drawing
a
blank
everything
there
were
a
lot
of
events
we
already
carried
on
from
previous
years
like
wics
games
and
mock
tech
interviews
that
i
really
loved
oh
wait
i
was
super
proud
of
our
first
wics
retreat
that
we
did
in
lake
arrowhead
i
think
that
was
the
place
that
felt
like
a
huge
accomplishment
because
we
had
always
wanted
one
and
never
had
one
and
the
trip
actually
went
well
and
people
liked
it
what
do
you
do
now
what
are
some

questions
ranged

questions
like

had

host
an

workshop
the

guided
everyone
through
the

or
variations
of
that
question
there
were
some
bumps
along
the
way
for
most
people
when
creating
the
skill
but
the
amazon
engineers
were
very
helpful
making
sure
that
everyone
had
a
chance
to
complete
the
workshop
in
the
end
most

wics
hosts
a
mentorship
program
we
pair
up
upperclassmen
mentors
with
underclassmen
in
ics
our
mentors
provide
not
just
tutoring
but
moral
support
and
general
guidance
many
of
our
mentors
and
mentees
have
become
good
friends
and
stay
in
touch
long
after
our
program
ends
mentees
benefit
significantly
for
having
experienced
and
relatable
guidance
in
their
first
years
and
our
mentors
can
stand
out
to
companies
by
working
with
our
organization
this
year
our
mentorship
program
is
using
the
family
system
where
each
family
consists
of
three
mentors
and
six
mentees
this
way
mentors
will
be
accompanied
by
their
co
mentors
during
the
program
and
mentees
are
able
to
bond
with
the
others
in
the
family

in
technology
international
hosted
a
panel
of
technology
experts
that
informed
the
audience
on
software
delivery
methods
the
key

were
some
really
successful
and
passionate
women
the
speakers
consist
of
diane
cochran
a

record
in

in
finance
printing

some
of
the
issues

are
the
pros

cons
of
using
agile

building
products
how
traditional

address
time

barriers

a
concern
and
the
best
ways

track
and
measure
development
progress

uci
s
first
annual
hackathon
was
a
huge
success
hackuci
was
hosted
at
peoplespace
where
people
can
collaborate
on
common
interests
in
computers
technology
science
art
entrepreneurship
and
start
up
business
the
small
cozy
venue
was
packed
with
awesome
ideas
and
much
energy
during
the
memorial
day
weekend
hackuci
was
so
spectacular
that
some
preferred
to
call
it
a
hack
festival
when
the
hackuci
opened
on
friday
evening
buses
streamed
participants
five
miles
from
campus
to
peoplespace
as
attendees
entered
they
were
greeted
by
a
live
performance
from
blake
kurt
as
the
event
started
hackers
had
access
to
everything
they
needed
to
work
on
their
project
during
their
stay
there
was
lots
of
free
food
including
muffins
and
croissants
for
breakfast
veggie
grill
and
chipotle
for
lunch
ray
s
pizza
and
dos
chinos
for
dinner
and
domino
s
pizza
and
85
degrees
for
midnight
snacks
caffeine
from
coffee
and
energy
drinks
were
of
course
a
necessity
for
those
who
wanted
to
stay
awake
for
the
entire
time
by
far
however
the
most
popular
item
among
the
hackers
was
none
other
than
uci
s
ring
road
specialty
lollicup
boba
this
free
drink
was
probably
a
first
in
the
history
of
hackathons
judging
by
the
overwhelming
response
of
the
participants
another
rare
attraction
was
the
dedicated
sleeping
area
located
at
the
back
of
the
venue
because
the
area
is
primarily
a
martial
arts
dojo
people
were
able
to
rest
on
the
mats
the
isolated
location
and
dim
lighting
made
it
a
better
place
to
sleep
than
inside
the
bright
and
noisy
hacking
areas
last
but
not
least
there
were
mentors
at
the
event
company
representatives
from
cylance
infinite
peripherals
amazon
sendgrid
and
kloudless
came
to
help
and
answer
any
questions
it
was
very
inspirational
to
see
that
several
hacker
participants
were
willing
to
help
out
other
teams
with
their
projects
the
core
values
of
inclusiveness
diversity
innovation
and
creativity
exhibited
by
everyone
would
definitely
make
hackuci
s
hackathon
forebearers
proud
in
the
end
all
projects
were
built
from
scratch
over
the
36
hour
period
the
teams
came
up
with
some
great
hacks
but
as
the
hacking
period
closed
only
a
handful
of
these
would
come
out
gloriously
on
top
one
of
these
teams
had
created
shark
education
which
allowed
the
player
to
see
through
the
eyes
of
a
shark
with
the
oculus
rift
for
legend
of
zelda
fans
one
of
the
best
twilio
hacks
was
a
hylian
transliterator
which
could
convert
english
to
any
of
the
several
hylian
languages
found
within
the
games
and
vice
versa
with
about
300
registrations
from
all
over
orange
county
hackuci
was
possibly
the
largest
event
ever
hosted
by
ics
clubs
wics
definitely
played
a
large
part
in
this
event
as
most
of
the
volunteers
were
wics
members
all
in
all
it
was
due
to
the
hard
work
commitment
and
sacrifice
of
the
volunteers
committee
members
and
main
organizers
that
such
an
astounding
event
was
pulled
off
i
can
t
wait
to
see
how
hackuci
will
grow
next
year

figure
out
what
she
wanted
to
work
on
while
kathy
described
it
as
the
best
summer
camp
ever
the
panel
ended
promptly
at
seven
due
to
the
engineers
having
to
catch
their
flights
back
home
and
the
night
closed
with
attendees
being
able
to
submit
their
resumes
and
pick
up
some
facebook
swag
we
had
a
great
turnout
with
over
60
people
attending
and
overall
the
event
was
a
terrific
experience
for
everyone
involved
hopefully
it
s
indicative
of
the
popularity
of
the
panels
yet
to
come

diana

on
october
17th
wics
had
their
mentorship
reveal
which
consisted
of
54
pairs
mentors
were
given
nametags
and
the
mentees
were
given
a
mission
to
find
the
balloon
with
their
name
on
it
pop
the
balloon
and
then
search
for
their
mentor
the
popping
noises
were
pretty
loud
but
it
made
the
atmosphere
lively
as
the
mentees
were
pretty
anxious
about
who
were
the
mentor
was
and
vice
versa
after
everyone
found
their
mentee
mentor
they
were
given
the
task
to
talk
with
one
another
and
get
to
know
each
other
then
mingle
with
another
pair
of
mentors
mentees
and
introduce
themselves
to
each
other
this
was
a
good
idea
so
pairs
can
bounce
off
ideas
from
one
another
on
how
often
to
meet
with
your
mentee
mentor
and
possibly
even
have
group
bondings
everyone
was
satisfied
with
meeting
their
match
so
thanks
samantha
applebaum
who
is
the
one
in
charge
of
the
mentorship
program
and
matching
each
pair
you
did
a
wonderful

vivian
thach
on
the
13th
of
april
wics
toured
riot
games
corporate
campus
in
los
angeles
to
gain
insight
of
the
game
development
industry
as
well
as
learn
what
drives
the
success
behind
riot
s
popular
game
league
of
legends
upon
our
arrival
at
the
campus
we
were
warmly
greeted
by
grant
cushman
riot
s
university
relations
recruiter
who
was
our
guide
for
the
tour
after
getting
our
name
tags
grant
gave
us
a
brief
introduction
to
what
league
of
legends
is
and
shared
with
us
how
it
has
grew
to
become
a
big
part
of
competitive
esports
we
were
then
greeted
by
a
large
annie
and
tibbers
statue
in
the
main
lobby
and
all
of
us
were
excited
to
take
pictures
with
it
next
we
were
led
to
see
meeting
rooms
themed
after
league
of
legends
champions
a
cafe
with
a
bilgewater
pirate
interior
a
large
cafeteria
serving
a
wide
selection
of
food
an
arcade
filled
with
retro
game
machines
an
internet
cafe
lined
with
rows
of
gaming
computers
and
open
workspaces
in
which
almost
every
desk
had
at
least
two
monitors
and
a
hardworking
employee
our
tour
was
wrapped
up
by
a
q
a
session
with
3
software
engineers
who
worked
in
different
departments
they
shed
some
light
into
the
life
of
working
in
a
game
company
the
challenges
they
face
as
well
as
how
working
in
the
game
industry
contrasts
to
working
in
other
industries
since
we
were
a
small
group
of
18
we
were
able
to
ask
all
of
our
questions
and
learned
a
lot
from
these
experienced
programmers
we
were
also
inspired
by
how
riot
employees
seemed
to
have
a
work
hard
play
hard
philosophy
as
many
of
them
play
games
together
while
still
taking
their
work
very
seriously
overall
we
are
truly
grateful
to
riot
games
for
giving
us
this
opportunity
to
tour
their
campus
as
we
learned
a
lot
about
the
game
industry
thanks
to
everyone
who
participated
and
we
hope
to
see
you
again

wics
had
their
very
first
week
0
social
the
event
was
located
in
the
common
room
of
the
berkeley
court
clubhouse
so
there
had
to
be
walk
groups
from
the
flagpoles
to
the
location
so
no
one
would
get
lost
the
social
was
meant
for
wics
members
new
and
old
to
get
to
know
each
other
and
socialize
more
people
came
than
expected
about
65
people
came
total
so
some
adjustments
had
to
be
made
with
the
snacks
besides
some
of
the
initial
difficulties
with
having
enough

different
teams
with
about
9
students
to
one
representative
and
all
the
teams
were
against
each
other
we
started
the
night
off
with
some
delicious
food
and
company
introductions
and
then
the
main
event
began
there
were
3
rounds
with
15
minutes

round
we
began
the
games
by
having
each
team
get

members
through
introductions
to
creating
a
team
chat
and
even
posting
a
funny
photo
of
themselves
on
different
social

platforms
the
rest
of
the
rounds
consisted

teams
working
together
to
solve
logic
puzzles
and
simple
coding
problems
after
all
the
rounds
were
completed

time
working

it
s
an
awesome
time
for
orange
county
youths
to
get
their
feet
wet
in
computer
science
this
winter
wics
has
paired
up
with
girls
who
code
at
woodbridge
high
school
to
host
a
series
of
workshops
for
youths
to
explore
the
field
of
computer
science
mentors
spent
4
weeks
with
35
eager
students
at
lathrop
intermediate
school
learning
about
careers
in
the
stem
field
through
computing
and
app
development
workshops
under
the
guidance
of
11
experienced
mentors
aspire
it
students
had
the
opportunity
to
practice
essential
coding
and
product
development
skills
using
mit
s
scratch
joylabz
makey
makey
boards
and
mit
s
app
inventor
after
grasping
the
basics
the
students
worked
in
teams
to
showcase
a
culminating
project
they
developed
using
scratch
we
also
had
guest
speakers
from
amazon
to
help
us
breakdown
cs
stereotypes
and
educate
the
students
on
real
opportunities
in
the
industry
and
of
course
in
between
grind
time
we
had
plenty
of
creative
activities
to
keep
us
on
our
toes
between
each
workshop
we
gathered
feedback
from
our
aspire
students
we
were
elated
to
find
that
the
program
achieved
its
desired
outcomes
one
student
when
asked
what
they
got
out
of
the
experience
said
i
got
that
it
doesn
t
matter
how
old
you
are
you
can
still
make
an
app
not
only
were
we
successfully
able
to
break
cs
stereotypes
but
the
students
also
had
a
lot
of
fun
when
asked
how
much
they
enjoyed
the
program
on
a
scale
of
1
to
10
88
